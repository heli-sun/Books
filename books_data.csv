Ecofeminist Science Fiction,['Douglas A. Vakoch'],"Ecofeminist Science Fiction: International Perspectives on Gender, Ecology, and Literature provides guidance in navigating some of the most pressing dangers we face today. Science fiction helps us face problems that threaten the very existence of humankind by giving us the emotional distance to see our current situation from afar, separated in our imaginations through time, space, or circumstance. Extrapolating from contemporary science, science fiction allows a critique of modern society, imagining more life-affirming alternatives. In this collection, ecocritics from five continents scrutinize science fiction for insights into the fundamental changes we need to make to survive and thrive as a species. Contributors examine ecofeminist themes in films, such as Avatar, Star Wars, and The Stepford Wives, as well as television series including Doctor Who and Westworld. Other scholars explore an internationally diverse group of both canonical and lesser-known science fiction writers including Oreet Ashery, Iraj Fazel Bakhsheshi, Liu Cixin, Louise Erdrich, Hanns Heinz Ewers, Larissa Lai, Ursula K. Le Guin, Chen Qiufan, Mary Doria Russell, Larissa Sansour, Karen Traviss, and Jeanette Winterson. Ecofeminist Science Fiction explores the origins of human-caused environmental change in the twin oppressions of women and of nature, driven by patriarchal power and ideologies. Female embodiment is examined through diverse natural and artificial forms, and queer ecologies challenge heteronormativity. The links between war and environmental destruction are analyzed, and the capitalist motivations and means for exploiting nature are critiqued through postcolonial perspectives.",['Fiction']
Anthology of Turkish Science Fiction Stories,"['Sümeyra Buran ', 'Veli Uğur']","Turkish science fiction dates back to the early years of the twentieth century and serious development has been seen ever since. The writers, who escaped from the darkness of the First World War and took refuge in utopian science fiction, added the excitement created by science and technology to their texts over time. Turkish writers, who followed the science fiction works from the West and made efforts for the development of this genre, produced very qualified works that could compete with their contemporaries at some points. However, due to some historical, social, and economic problems, it was not possible for these works to meet readers in the West. In this anthology, the works of Turkish science fiction writers are brought together for the first time in English. Contemporary science fiction writers have written short stories for this anthology. Hence, the resulting diversity of stories represents a contribution to science fiction literature. An important feature of the anthology is that it includes examples showing how science and technology are perceived philosophically by authors outside of Europe and America. Since literature is an indispensable resource to investigate the equivalent of science fiction, which was born with modernism, in ""post-modern"" societies. This anthology of Turkish science fiction will be an important Non-Western SF source for both science fiction readers and researchers.",['Philosophy']
Science Fiction Demographics,"['Ethan Rodriguez', 'AI']","Science Fiction Demographics explores the readership of science fiction, revealing how this informs our understanding of cultural and economic trends. The book highlights the genre's substantial market growth, noting its evolution from a niche interest to a mainstream phenomenon. Interestingly, shifts in science fiction readership often mirror broader societal changes, acting as a potential bellwether for emerging cultural values and technological adoption. For example, increased readership among specific demographics might correlate with growing interest in related technologies or social issues. The book adopts a data-driven approach, using industry surveys and market research to analyze readership patterns. It examines specific demographic groups, their preferences, and purchasing habits, further exploring the impact of digital platforms on readership, including e-books and online communities. This allows publishers, marketers, and content creators to develop targeted strategies. The book progresses logically, introducing core concepts, analyzing specific demographics, and discussing implications for various stakeholders, making it a valuable resource for understanding the dynamic relationship between science fiction and society.",['Social Science']
The Science Fiction of Poetics and the Avant-Garde Imagination,['Michael Golston'],"How the tropes of science fiction infuse and inform avant-garde poetics and many other kindred arts This insightful, playful monograph from Golston does exactly what it advertises: modeling poetics based on how poetry (and some parallel artistic endeavors) has filtered through a century-plus of science fiction. This is not a book about science fiction in and of itself, but it is a book about the resonances of science-fiction tropes and ideas in poetic language. The germ of Golston’s project is a throwaway line in Robert Smithson’s Entropy and the New Monuments about how cinema supplanted nature as inspiration for many of his fellow artists: “The movies give a ritual pattern to the lives of many artists, and this induces a kind of ‘low budget’ mysticism, which keeps them in a perpetual trance.” Golston charts how the demotic appeal of sci-fi, much like that of the B-movie, cross-pollinated into poetry and other branches of the avant garde. Golston creates what he calls a “regular Rube Goldberg machine” of a critical apparatus, drawing on Walter Benjamin, Roman Jakobson, and Gilles Deleuze. He starts by acknowledging that, per the important work of Darko Suvin to situate science fiction critically, the genre is premised on cognitive estrangement. But he is not interested in the specific nuts and bolts of science fiction as it exists but rather how science fiction has created a model not only for other poets but also for musicians and landscape artists. Golston’s critical lens moves around quite a bit, but he begins with familiar enough subjects: Edgar Rice Burroughs, Mina Loy, William S. Burroughs. From there he moves into more “alien” terrain: Ed Dorn’s long poem Gunslinger, the discombobulated work of Clark Coolidge. Sun Ra, Ornette Coleman, and Jimi Hendrix all come under consideration. The result of Golston’s restless, rich scholarship is the first substantial monograph on science fiction and avant-garde poetics, using Russian Formalism, Frankfurt School dialectics, and Deleuzian theory to show how the avant-garde inherently follows the parameters of sci fi, in both theme and form.",['Literary Criticism']

Some science fiction films, television programs, and video games are also mentioned, particularly when they are relevant to written texts. Its focus is on science fiction in the English language, though due attention is given to international authors whose works have been frequently translated into English.

Age and Ageing in Contemporary Speculative and Science Fiction,"['Sarah Falcus', 'Maricel Oró-Piqueras']","Focusing on the contemporary period, this book brings together critical age studies and contemporary science fiction to establish the centrality of age and ageing in dystopian, speculative and science-fiction imaginaries. Analysing texts from Europe, North America and South Asia, as well as television programmes and films, the contributions range from essays which establish genre-based trends in the representation of age and ageing, to very focused studies of particular texts and concerns. As a whole, the volume probes the relationship between speculative/science fiction and our understanding of what it is to be a human in time: the time of our own lives and the times of both the past and the future.",['Literary Criticism']
Arab and Muslim Science Fiction,"['Hosam A. Ibrahim Elzembely', 'Emad El-Din Aysha']","How is science fiction from the Arab and Muslim world different than mainstream science fiction from the West? What distinctive and original contributions can it make? Why is it so often neglected in critical considerations of the genre? While other books have explored these questions, all have been from foreign academic voices. Instead, this book examines the nature, genesis, and history of Arabic and Muslim science fiction, as well as the challenges faced by its authors, in the authors' own words. These authors share their stories and struggles with censors, recalcitrant publishers, critics, the book market, and the literary establishment. Their uphill efforts, with critical contributions from academics, translators, and literary activists, will enlighten the sci-fi enthusiast and fill a gap in the history of science fiction. Topics covered range from culture shock to conflicts between tradition and modernity, proactive roles for female heroines, blind imitation of storytelling techniques, and language games.",['Literary Criticism']
Technoculture in Margaret Atwood’s Science Fiction Novels,['Jasmine Sharma'],"The contemporary mediation between technoscience and philosophy offers overwhelming insights into the literary-critical domain of thought. This book conceptualizes an enriching engagement with questions pertaining to the notion of technology and how its blend with cultural facets makes comprehensive room for the reconstitution of the literary landscape in Atwood’s science fiction (SF) novels. Ranging from the technologies of disciplinary and bio-corporeal power to theorizing gender politics of cyborgian, nomadic and humanoid bodies, from technologizing the consumption of hybrid edibles and lingual epistemology to discerning the hyperreal dimensions of archived tech-memoirs, video gaming and digital sex, the book takes a philosophical approach to technocultural studies, a newly emerging interdisciplinary methodology. It contributes to an optimal concretization of technoscientific exploration in Margaret Atwood’s literary scholarship and adds to the existing field of theoretical acumen within cosmopolitan literatures.",['Literary Criticism']

SCIENCE FICTION THE WONDER OF HUMAN IMAGINATION,['Andreas Sofroniou'],"Science Fiction explores the probable consequences of some improbable or impossible transformation of the basic conditions of human (or intelligent non-human) existence. This transformation need not be a technological invention, but may be some mutation of known biological or physical reality: artificial or extraterrestrial life-forms and travel through time are favourite subjects. Science Fiction stories may involve Utopian political speculation, or satire, but most rely on the marvellous appeal of fantasy. The term Science Fiction was first given general currency by Hugo Gernsback, editor of the popular Amazing Stories magazine from 1926. Once uniformly dismissed as pulp trash, SF gained greater respect from the 1950s, as writers like Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, and John Wyndham expanded its range; themes of alien invasion and brain-washing became especially popular at the height of the Cold War.",['Fiction']
The Science Fiction Dimensions of Salman Rushdie,['Yael Maurer'],"This book focuses on the science fictional dimensions of Rushdie's later novels, Fury, The Ground Beneath Her Feet, Shalimar the Clown and Luka and the Fire of Life, and Rushdie's first unpublished novel, The Antagonist, to show how the author's oeuvre moves towards a more consistent engagement with science fiction as a generic form and an ideological investment. The author demonstrates how Rushdie recreates personal and national histories in a science fictional setting and mode, and contends that the failure of his first novel Grimus may have led Rushdie away from SF for some time, although he returns to it with a much firmer conviction and a much stronger voice in his later novels, showing his commitment to this imaginative form which he describes in Fury as providing ""the best popular vehicle ever devised for the novel of ideas and metaphysics.""The science fictional mode is the most appropriate vehicle for expressing these thematic and ideological concerns and the organizing feature of Rushdie's oeuvre. The author rereads the later novels in light of recent critical engagement with SF as a vehicle for reimagining national histories and as a potentially subversive tool for social and political engagement in a fictional realm.",['Literary Criticism']
Exploring Science Through Science Fiction,['Barry B. Luokkala'],"How does Einstein’s description of space and time compare with Doctor Who? Can James Bond really escape from an armor-plated railroad car by cutting through the floor with a laser concealed in a wristwatch? What would it take to create a fully intelligent android, such as Star Trek’s Commander Data? Exploring Science Through Science Fiction addresses these and other intriguing questions, using science fiction as a springboard for discussing fundamental science concepts and cutting-edge science research. It includes references to original research papers, landmark scientific publications and technical documents, as well as a broad range of science literature at a more popular level. The revised second edition includes expanded discussions on topics such as gravitational waves and black holes, machine learning and quantum computing, gene editing, and more.

Science Fiction and Speculative Fiction,['P. L. Thomas'],"Why did Kurt Vonnegut shun being labeled a writer of science fiction (SF)? How did Margaret Atwood and Ursula K. Le Guin find themselves in a public argument about the nature of SF? This volume explores the broad category of SF as a genre, as one that challenges readers, viewers, teachers, and scholars, and then as one that is often itself challenged (as the authors in the collection do). SF, this volume acknowledges, is an enduring argument. The collected chapters include work from teachers, scholars, artists, and a wide range of SF fans, offering a powerful and unique blend of voices to scholarship about SF as well as examinations of the place for SF in the classroom. Among the chapters, discussions focus on SF within debates for and against SF, the history of SF, the tensions related to SF and other genres, the relationship between SF and science, SF novels, SF short fiction, SF film and visual forms (including TV), SF young adult fiction, SF comic books and graphic novels, and the place of SF in contemporary public discourse.

The History of Science Fiction and Its Toy Figurines,['Luigi Toiati'],"""This eye-opening book deserves a spot on the bookshelves of anyone who not only enjoys collecting, but also has a great interest in all facets of the history of our hobby."" — Toy Soldier Collector Science fiction, as the name suggests, is the combination of science and fantasy. In addition to a literary form, it also encompasses film, TV, comics, toys and our beloved toy astronauts, or other figures such as aliens, monsters and other playable genres. The term science fiction was coined by publisher Hugo Gernsbach around the first decades of the last century to refer to the predominantly 'space' adventures covered in his magazines. Space invaded radio, cinema, TV, and consequently for a long time toy figurines were predominantly space-related, later evolving into other themes. This lavishly illustrated book covers both the history of literary science fiction, following in the footsteps of contemporary official criticism, and toy figurines inspired by science fiction. You will also find several other themes, such as the link between science fiction figures and cinema, radio, TV, comics, and more. Luigi Toiati offers to both guide the reader on an often-nostalgic walk through science fiction in all its various forms, and to describe the figurines and brands associated with it.",['Literary Criticism']

Science Fiction and Indian Women Writers,['Urvashi Kuhad'],"Science fiction, as a literature of fantasy, goes beyond the mundane to ask the question: what if the world were different from the way it is? It often challenges the real, builds on imagination, places no limits on human capacities, and encourages readers to think outside their social and cultural conditioning. This book presents a systematic study of Indian women’s science fiction. It offers a critical analysis of the works of four female Indian writers of science fiction: Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, Manjula Padmanabhan, Priya Sarukkai Chabria and Vandana Singh. The author considers not only the evolution of science fiction writing in India, but also discusses the use of innovations and unique themes including science fiction in different Indian languages; the literary, political, and educational activism of the women writers; and eco-feminism and the idea of cloning in writing, to argue that this genre could be viewed as a vibrant representation of freedom of expression and radical literature.

Pulpit Science Fiction,['George L. Murphy'],"To keep the Christian message relevant in our rapidly changing times, it's vital that churches come to terms with how modern technology and scientific knowledge have changed the way we understand the world. And because preaching is the church's primary mode of communication (especially with adults), it offers a significant opportunity to shape how we think about the larger questions of our existence. One innovative way for preachers to address these concerns is through popular science fiction. Because many of the genre's stories deal with the impact of science and technology on individuals and cultures, they often have implicit religious implications. Pulpit Science Fiction is a fascinating collection of creative story sermons that shows how you can use elements drawn from science fiction to boldly proclaim the Christian faith. In addition to 14 imaginative ""science fiction parables,"" a pair of essays are also included that illustrate how references to science fiction films and stories can be utilized in preaching. George Murphy has extended Christian parable telling into the 21st century with a series of preachable stories. These engaging, sometimes poignant, and often provocative tales spotlight particular theological themes from scripture. Comments following each pulpit-tested story help to contextualize it in relation to literary sources and the liturgical year. This book is a remarkable gift to those charged with proclaiming the Word to that spacefaring species, Homo sapiens.

Science Fiction Rise,"['Serena Vaughn', 'AI']","Science Fiction Rise explores the surprising and powerful connection between science fiction narratives and real-world technological innovation. It examines how science fiction has not only predicted future technologies but has also actively influenced their development. The book highlights how our collective imagination, spurred by sci-fi, acts as a key driver of technological advancement. For example, ideas first explored in science fiction, like robotics and space exploration, have demonstrably shaped scientific inquiry and funding priorities. The book argues that science fiction is more than just a reflection of technological trends; it's an active participant in shaping them. It acts as a kind of creative laboratory, where concepts are tested and refined, ultimately influencing scientific research. The book presents this information with historical and cultural context, analyzing key science fiction works alongside actual technological breakthroughs. The book is structured into three sections, starting with an introduction to the history and themes of science fiction. It then delves into specific case studies, such as artificial intelligence and its portrayal in science fiction, before concluding with a discussion of the ethical responsibilities of shaping the future through technology. This approach allows readers to understand both the historical impact and the potential future role of science fiction in innovation.",['Technology & Engineering']
Modern Sci-Fi Films FAQ,['Tom DeMichael'],"(FAQ). Many science fiction movies from the last 40 years have blazed new vistas for viewers.

Young Adult Science Fiction,['C. W. Sullivan III'],"At the close of the nineteenth century, American youths developed a growing interest in electricity and its applications, machines, and gadgetry. When authors and publishers recognized the extent of this interest in technology, they sought to create reading materials that would meet this market need. The result was science fiction written especially for young adults. While critics tended to neglect young adult science fiction for decades, they gradually came to recognize its practical and cultural value. Science fiction inspired many young adults to study science and engineering and helped foster technological innovation. At the same time, these works also explored cultural and social concerns more commonly associated with serious literature. Nor was young adult science fiction a peculiarly American phenomenon: authors in other countries likewise wrote science fiction for young adult readers. This book examines young adult science fiction in the U.S. and several other countries and explores issues central to the genre. The first part of the book treats the larger contexts of young adult science fiction and includes chapters on its history and development. Included are discussions of science fiction for young adults in the U.S. and in Canada, Great Britain, Germany, and Australia. These chapters are written by expert contributors and chart the history of young adult science fiction from the nineteenth century to the present. The second section of the book considers topics of special interest to young adult science fiction. Some of the chapters look at particular forms and expressions of science fiction, such as films and comic books. Others treat particular topics, such as the portrayal of women in Robert Heinlein's works and representations of war in young adult science fiction. Yet another chapter studies the young adult science fiction novel as a coming-of-age story and thus helps distinguish the genre from science fiction written for adult readers. All chapters reflect current research, and the volume concludes with extensive bibliographies.",['Literary Criticism']
Narrative of Chinese and Western Popular Fiction,['Yonglin Huang'],"This book presents a comprehensive and systematic study of the narrative history and narrative methods of Chinese and Western popular fiction from the perspectives of narratology, comparative literature, and art and literature studies by adopting the methodology of parallel comparison. The book is a pioneering work that systematically investigates the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western popular fiction, and traces the root causes leading to the differences. By means of narrative comparison, it explores the conceptual and spiritual correlations and differences between Chinese and Western popular fiction and, by relating them to the root causes of cultural spirit, allows us to gain an insight into the cultural heritage of different nations. The book is structured in line with a cause-and-effect logical sequence and moves from the macroscopic to the microscopic, from history to reality, and from theory to practice. The integration of macro-level theoretical studies and micro-level case studies is both novel and effective. This book was awarded Second Prize at the Sixth Outstanding Achievement Awards in Scientific Research for Chinese Institutions of Higher Learning (Humanities & Social Sciences, 2013).",['Literary Criticism']

Science Fiction and the Moral Imagination,['Russell Blackford'],"In this highly original book, Russell Blackford discusses the intersection of science fiction and humanity’s moral imagination. With the rise of science and technology in the 19th century, and our continually improving understanding of the cosmos, writers and thinkers soon began to imagine futures greatly different from the present. Science fiction was born out of the realization that future technoscientific advances could dramatically change the world. Along with the developments described in modern science fiction - space societies, conscious machines, and upgraded human bodies, to name but a few - come a new set of ethical challenges and new forms of ethics. Blackford identifies these issues and their reflection in science fiction. His fascinating book will appeal to anyone with an interest in philosophy or science fiction, or in how they interact. “This is a seasoned, balanced analysis of a major issue in our thinking about the future, seen through the lens of science fiction, a central art of our time. Everyone from humanists to technologists should study these ideas and examples. Blackford’s book is wise and savvy, and a delight to read as well.” Greg Benford, author of Timescape.",['Philosophy']

"Islam, Science Fiction and Extraterrestrial Life",['Jörg Matthias Determann'],"The Muslim world is not commonly associated with science fiction. Religion and repression have often been blamed for a perceived lack of creativity, imagination and future-oriented thought. However, even the most authoritarian Muslim-majority countries have produced highly imaginative accounts on one of the frontiers of knowledge: astrobiology, or the study of life in the universe. This book argues that the Islamic tradition has been generally supportive of conceptions of extra-terrestrial life, and in this engaging account, Jörg Matthias Determann provides a survey of Arabic, Bengali, Malay, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu texts and films, to show how scientists and artists in and from Muslim-majority countries have been at the forefront of the exciting search. Determann takes us to little-known dimensions of Muslim culture and religion, such as wildly popular adaptations of Star Wars and mysterious movements centred on UFOs. Repression is shown to have helped science fiction more than hurt it, with censorship encouraging authors to disguise criticism of contemporary politics by setting plots in future times and on distant planets. The book will be insightful for anyone looking to explore the science, culture and politics of the Muslim world and asks what the discovery of extra-terrestrial life would mean for one of the greatest faiths.",['History']

"Reality Simulation in Science Fiction Literature, Film and Television",['Heather Duerre Humann'],"In recent decades, science fiction in both print and visual media has produced an outpouring of story lines that feature forms of simulated reality. These depictions appear with such frequency that fictional portrayals of simulated worlds have become a popular sci-fi trope--one that prompts timeless questions about the nature of reality while also tapping into contemporary debates about emerging technologies. In combination with tech-driven tensions, this study shows that our collective sense of living in politically uncertain times also propels the popularity of these story lines. Because of the kinds of questions they raise and the cultural anxieties they provoke, these fictional representations provide a window into contemporary culture and demonstrate how we are reassessing our own reality.",['Literary Criticism']
Challenging Anthropocentrism in Eco-Science Fiction Novels,['Fatma Gamze Erkan'],"This book explores the relationship between humanity and nature while challenging the notion that anthropocentric behaviour causes the environmental catastrophes depicted in the four selected British eco-science fiction novels.

Ballard’s The Drought (1965), Brian Aldiss’s Earthworks (1965), and John Brunner’s The Sheep Look Up (1972), all of which fictionalise the fact that the consequences of environmental problems can be diverse but equally serious. This book examines how even the smallest damage caused by human beings to the environment negatively affects them, other living beings, and the ecosystem they need to live and flourish. In conjunction with these, the factors and conditions that push characters in the novels to ignore and harm the environment are also scrutinised. While examining how and why the environmental problems in the novels have arisen, it is evaluated whether the authors propose solutions to these problems and, if so, what they are.",['Literary Criticism']

Reading Programs for Young Adults,['Martha Seif Simpson'],"School and public libraries often provide programs and activities for children in preschool through the sixth grade, but there is little available to young adults. For them, libraries become a place for work—the place to research an assignment or find a book for a report—but the thought of the library as a place for enjoyment is lost. So how do librarians recapture the interest of teenagers? This just might be the answer. Here you will find theme-based units (such as Cartoon Cavalcade, Log On at the Library, Go in Style, Cruising the Mall, Space Shots, Teens on TV, and 44 others) that are designed for young adults. Each includes a display idea, suggestions for local sponsorship of prizes, a program game to encourage participation, 10 theme-related activities, curriculum tie-in activities, sample questions for use in trivia games or scavenger hunts, ideas for activity sheets, a bibliography of related works, and a list of theme-related films.

"OVER EXCESSIVE AMBITION AS REFLECTED IN THREE SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS: FRANKENSTEIN, SOLARIS AND INFERNAL DEVICES",['KHULOD H. HUSAIN'],"This book attempts to explore the emergence of science fiction as a genre and its development into steampunk as a subgenre of science fiction in selected science fiction novels: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1823), Stanislaw Lem's Solaris (1970) and K. W. Jeter's Infernal Devices (1987). This research shows that the scientists in these novels drag themselves into darkness. Victor, the protagonists of Frankenstein, is an ambition scientist who wants to conquer death but tragically loses his family during this endeavor. Kelvin, the hero of Solaris, is psychologically devastated when he struggles to understand how Solaris ocean creates a simulation of people. The hero of the third novel, George Dewar's father, a mad scientist and inventor, creates a double of his own son as a robot tries to destroy the earth. The main argument of this research is that all these novels set in different eras draw on science fiction to criticize and question man's greedy and unrestricted desire for scientific discovery to the extent that they want to conquer the universe and play the role of God. The study will ask the following questions: How do the ambitious scientists in the novels drag themselves into madness? And how does the scientific desire turn into a crave for transcendence bringing about their damnation? What do these scientific explorations and inventions reveal about human nature? Does steampunk bring evolution to the future as a sub-genre of science fiction?",['Fiction']
The Speculative Route,"['Merve Tabur', 'Sami Ahmad Khan']","The Speculative Route explores speculative traditions and science fictional modes across South and Southwest Asia and North Africa (SSWANA), examining their historical connections, inter- and intra-regional entanglements, overlaps, and differences. Conceptualizing science fiction and fantasy (SFF) as a mode rather than a genre, this volume challenges the putative boundaries between literary and genre fiction through critical studies and essays focusing on SFF from Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Iran, Pakistan, Palestine, Sri Lanka, and Turkey. It demonstrates the ways in which science fictional modes of thinking and imagination function as critical tools for addressing social, cultural, and political issues beyond genre conventions and expectations. Bringing together articles by leading scholars of SFF and think-pieces by acclaimed authors of contemporary SF, this volume focuses on central themes such as the relationship between aesthetics and politics, alterity, world-building, memory, trauma, colonialism and decolonization, ecology, gender, religion, and mythopoetics. It engages with the past, present, and future of speculative traditions in SSWANA, and compares the visions that emerge from these seemingly disparate––but historically connected––entities. Part of the Studies in Global Genre Fiction series, this volume will be of great interest to academics, students, and practitioners in the fields of genre studies (notably, SF, SFF), comparative literature, media and popular culture, area studies, postcolonial studies, and future studies, as well as to readers who are interested in exploring SFF works from the Global South.",['Literary Criticism']

This is the first book about them. Few persons outside the science fiction field (where, historically, fanzine publication appears to have begun) know the meaning of the portmanteau word, fan­zine (amateur fan plus magazine). Fanzines are published, written, and illustrated by young persons, usually well under 30, and bear such names as ANDROmeda, BeABohema, Comickazi, Granfalloon, and Varolika. The history of the genre is brief, dating from the 1930s, but many of the publishers and contrib­utors have achieved considerable distinc­tion as writers, including Poul Anderson, Ray Bradbury, and Richard Lupoff. Coming to this serious study of an unu­sual subject with his considerable expertise in the field of violence, Dr. Wertham has been struck, first, by the nonviolent, creative aspects of the genre and, second, by the amateur status of fanzines.

Four Day Planet & Lone Star Planet,['H. Beam Piper'],"H. Beam Piper's ""Four Day Planet"" and ""Lone Star Planet"" are exemplary works that delve into the intricacies of human society in richly imagined futures. Piper employs a blend of hard science fiction and speculative world-building, crafting narratives that explore themes of survival, social structure, and morality against the backdrop of vividly realized alien environments. The prose is marked by Piper's deft handling of dialogue and character development, creating a tapestry of interstellar adventure that reflects mid-20th century anxieties and aspirations, particularly regarding colonization and cultural diversity. Piper, an influential figure in early science fiction, drew inspiration from his varied interests in history, philosophy, and technology. His background as a writer in the 1940s and 1950s, when the genre was beginning to flourish, informs the complex socio-political landscapes he explores in these novels. Personal experiences and an affinity for exploring the consequences of interspecies interaction played pivotal roles in shaping the narratives that resonate so deeply with readers. This collection is a must-read for enthusiasts of classic science fiction and those seeking profound reflections on human nature and societal constructs. Piper's works not only entertain but also challenge readers to contemplate the moral dilemmas posed by advancement and coexistence.

The World Set Free,['H G Wells'],"Herbert George Wells (21 September 1866 - 13 August 1946) was an English writer. He was prolific in many genres, writing dozens of novels, short stories, and works of social commentary, satire, biography, and autobiography, and even including two books on recreational war games. He is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is often called a ""father of science fiction"", along with Jules Verne and Hugo Gernsback. During his own lifetime, however, he was most prominent as a forward-looking, even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale. A futurist, he wrote a number of utopian works and foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web. His science fiction imagined time travel, alien invasion, invisibility, and biological engineering. Brian Aldiss referred to Wells as the ""Shakespeare of science fiction"". Wells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption - dubbed ""Wells's law"" - leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 as ""O Realist of the Fantastic!"". His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), The War of the Worlds (1898) and the military science fiction The War in the Air (1907). Wells was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times. The Island of Doctor Moreau is an 1896 science fiction novel by English author H. G. Wells. The text of the novel is the narration of Edward Prendick, a shipwrecked man rescued by a passing boat who is left on the island home of Doctor Moreau, a mad scientist who creates human-like hybrid beings from animals via vivisection. The novel deals with a number of philosophical themes, including pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, and human interference with nature. Wells described it as ""an exercise in youthful blasphemy."" The Island of Doctor Moreau is a classic of early science fiction and remains one of Wells' best-known books. The novel is the earliest depiction of the science fiction motif ""uplift"" in which a more advanced race intervenes in the evolution of an animal species to bring the latter to a higher level of intelligence. It has been adapted to film and other media on many occasions, with Charles Laughton (1933), Burt Lancaster (1977), and Marlon Brando (1996) as the mad doctor. (wikipedia.org)",['N/A']
Against the Fall of Night,['Arthur C. Clarke'],"The renowned science fiction author's landmark novel of the last human born on a far future world--and his quest for the truth about existence. Living in the ten-billion-year-old city of Diaspar, Alvin is the last child born of humanity, and he is intensely curious about the outside world. But according to the oldest histories kept by the city fathers, there is no outside world--it was destroyed by the Invaders millions of years ago. One day, Alvin finds a rock with an inscription seemingly meant for him: ""There is a better way. Give my greetings to the Keeper of the Records. Alaine of Lyndar."" This cryptic message takes Alvin on a quest to discover humanity's true past--and its future. Originally published in the November 1948 issue of Startling Stories, Against the Fall of Night is a rich and intensely poetic vision of a distant future that's sure to delight fans of Clarke and science fiction as a genre. ""[Clarke is] one of the truly prophetic figures of the space age."" --The New Yorker",['Fiction']
The War of the Worlds (1898): Science Fiction,['H. G. Wells'],"The narrative opens by stating that as humans on Earth busied themselves with their own endeavours during the 1890s, aliens on Mars began plotting an invasion of Earth to replenish their limited resources. In 1899 the narrator is invited to an astronomical observatory at Ottershaw where explosions are seen on the surface of the planet Mars, creating much interest in the scientific community. Later, a ""meteor"" lands on Horsell Common, near the unnamed narrator's home in Woking, Surrey. He is among the first to discover that the object is an artificial cylinder that opens, disgorging Martians who are ""big"" and ""greyish"" with ""oily brown skin,"" ""the size, perhaps, of a bear,"" each with ""two large dark-coloured eyes,"" and lipless ""V-shaped mouths"" which drip saliva and are surrounded by two ""Gorgon groups of tentacles."" The narrator finds them ""at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous.""[7] They briefly emerge, have difficulty in coping with the Earth's atmosphere and gravity, and rapidly retreat into their cylinder. A human deputation (which includes the astronomer Ogilvy) approaches the cylinder with a white flag, but the Martians incinerate them and others nearby with a heat-ray before beginning to assemble their machinery. Military forces arrive that night to surround the common, including Maxim guns. The population of Woking and the surrounding villages are reassured by the presence of the British Army. A tense day begins, with much anticipation of military action by the narrator.After heavy firing from the common and damage to the town from the heat-ray which suddenly erupts in the late afternoon, the narrator takes his wife to safety in nearby Leatherhead, where his cousin lives, using a rented, two-wheeled horse cart; he then returns to Woking to return the cart when in the early morning hours, a violent thunderstorm erupts. On the road during the height of the storm, he has his first terrifying sight of a fast-moving Martian fighting-machine; in a panic he crashes the horse cart, barely escaping detection. He discovers the Martians have assembled towering three-legged ""fighting-machines"" (tripods), each armed with a heat-ray and a chemical weapon: the poisonous ""black smoke."" These tripods have wiped out the army units positioned around the cylinder and attacked and destroyed most of Woking. Sheltering in his house, the narrator sees a fleeing artilleryman moving through his garden, who later tells the narrator of his experiences and mentions that another cylinder has landed between Woking and Leatherhead, cutting off the narrator from his wife. The two try to escape via Byfleet just after dawn, but are separated at the Shepperton to Weybridge Ferry during a Martian afternoon attack on Shepperton. One of the Martian fighting-machines is brought down in the River Thames by artillery as the narrator and countless others try to cross the river into Middlesex, as the Martians retreat back to their original crater. This gives the authorities precious hours to form a defence-line covering London. After the Martians' temporary repulse, the narrator is able to float down the Thames in a boat toward London, stopping at Walton, where he first encounters the curate, his companion for the coming weeks.... Herbert George Wells (21 September 1866 - 13 August 1946), usually referred to as H. G. Wells, was an English writer. He was prolific in many genres, writing dozens of novels, short stories, and works of social commentary, satire, biography, and autobiography, including even two books on war games.",['Fiction']
Sirius,['Olaf Stapledon'],"In ""Sirius,"" Olaf Stapledon masterfully weaves a poignant narrative that explores the intricate relationship between humanity and a highly intelligent dog named Sirius. Set against a backdrop of speculative philosophy, the novel delves into themes of identity, consciousness, and the boundaries of species. Written in a lyrical, reflective style characteristic of Stapledon's work, the text invites readers to contemplate profound questions about existence and the nature of intelligence, framing Sirius not just as a canine companion but as a symbol of untapped potential and alienation within the human experience. The literary context speaks to the early 20th-century fascination with scientific advancements and the ethical dilemmas they present, making it a cornerstone of speculative fiction. Olaf Stapledon, known for his visionary approach to science fiction, was deeply influenced by the philosophical movements and scientific developments of his time, including the burgeoning field of psychology and evolutionary theory. His earlier works established him as a pioneer of speculative narratives, and ""Sirius"" emerges from this fertile intellectual landscape as a triumph of his avant-garde style'Äîa testament to his commitment to pushing the boundaries of imagination and literature. I highly recommend ""Sirius"" to anyone interested in a thought-provoking exploration of consciousness that transcends the typical boundaries of genre. Stapledon'Äôs keen insights and innovative narrative will resonate with readers who appreciate philosophical depth intertwined with rich storytelling, positioning the novel as an essential read for both fans of speculative fiction and those intrigued by questions of what it means to truly understand another being.",['Fiction']

Conscripted into service for the United Nations Exploratory Force, a highly trained unit built for revenge, physics student William Mandella fights for his planet light years away against the alien force known as the Taurans. “Mandella’s attempt to survive and remain human in the face of an absurd, almost endless war is harrowing, hilarious, heartbreaking, and true,” says Pulitzer Prize–winning novelist Junot Díaz—and because of the relative passage of time when one travels at incredibly high speed, the Earth Mandella returns to after his two-year experience has progressed decades and is foreign to him in disturbing ways… Now celebrating its 50th anniversary, The Forever War is based in part on the author’s experiences in Vietnam. It is regarded as one of the greatest military science fiction novels ever written, capturing the alienation that servicemen and women experience even now upon returning home from battle. This book shines a light not only on the culture of the 1970s in which it was written, but also on our potential future. “To say that The Forever War is the best science fiction war novel ever written is to damn it with faint praise. It is…as fine and woundingly genuine a war story as any I’ve read” (William Gibson). This ebook features an illustrated biography of Joe Haldeman including rare images from the author’s personal collection",['Fiction']

The novel, set against the burgeoning backdrop of early 20th-century science fiction, provides a fascinating exploration of otherworldly domains and the perennial quest for knowledge that leads a cadre of close friends into the extraordinary enigma at the heart of the story. In analyzing Flint's contribution to the sci-fi canon, one cannot overlook the intricate plotlines and pioneering themes that mark 'The Blind Spot' as a precursor to later multidimensional voyage narratives. As a prominent figure in the early science fiction movement, Homer Eon Flint's oeuvre evinces a keen interest in the unknown and the imaginative possibilities of scientific endeavors. His personal fascination with the frontiers of science and the potential of human discovery may well have served as the spark for 'The Blind Spot.'

These influences are interwoven in his work, offering a window into the boundless curiosity and creative spirit that drove his literary ventures.

Just Over the Horizon,['Greg Bear'],"The New York Times Book Review hails this collection of thirteen dazzling stories and a rare screenplay by Hugo and Nebula Award–winning author Greg Bear as a “solid introduction to the oeuvre of a classic writer.” Greg Bear—author of Queen of Angels, Eon, and Hull Zero Three, among many other hugely popular novels—has an ability to transform challenging scientific concepts into gripping fiction that has won him numerous awards and an avid following. He has written novels about interstellar war, human evolution, intelligent bacteria, international terrorism, and the exploration of deep space—but he doesn’t stop there. This brilliant collection of Bear’s stories, each newly revised by the author, proves he is a master of the short form as well. Just Over the Horizon offers thirteen mind-bending explorations of the near future . . . or just beyond the border of conventional reality. The volume includes: · “Blood Music,” a Hugo and Nebula award–winning classic and the basis for the novel of the same name—and the first science-fictional exploration of nanotechnology; · “Sisters,” in which high school students find maturity and family by confronting a tragic genetic destiny; · “Tangents,” winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards, about a persecuted scientist who seeks refuge in a better world; · “Dead Run,” a tale of union truck drivers ferrying souls through Death Valley into Hell, adapted for an episode of the television series The Twilight Zone; · “Sleepside Story,” which Bear calls one of his favorite pieces, an urban fantasy tale that takes a music student by Night Metro to the Sleepside mansion of a magical woman of the night, inverting “Beauty and the Beast” in a very modern mirror; · “Genius,” the screenplay written for the television series Outer Limits, but never produced. Just Over the Horizon combines Bear’s intense concern with the human condition with a deep understanding of science, resulting in a collection long to be remembered.",['Fiction']

Using Intergroup Contact to Fight Prejudice and Negative Attitudes,"['Loris Vezzali', 'Sofia Stathi']","In this groundbreaking volume, Vezzali and Stathi present their research program within the larger contact literature, examining classic theories and current empirical findings, to show how they can be used to reduce prejudice and negative attitudes. The contact hypothesis (Allport, 1954) posits that in an environment of equality, cooperation, and normative support, contact between members of distinct groups can reduce prejudice. Whilst considerable research supports this hypothesis, how theory can be tested in the field remains relatively unexplored. In this innovative book, Vezzali and Stathi discuss why relying solely on advancing theory without considering applied aspects integral to contact may limit the scope of contact theory and restrict our understanding of complex social phenomena. Exploring fascinating topics such as the role of contact in reducing implicit prejudice and fostering collective action, applying indirect contact, and promoting positive interactions among survivors of natural disasters, Vezzali and Stathi explain how contact theory can be implemented and enhance the societal impact of intergroup contact research. Featuring extensive discussion on intergroup contact literature, future directions, and the necessity of applied research, this book will be essential reading for both students and academics of social and behavioral psychology.",['Psychology']

This will, due to space restrictions, be achieved through an exemplary analysis of the three genres that were amongst the most frequently mentioned in connection with the Harry Potter books: Fantasy, the folktale, and the school story. Before taking a closer look at the three major genres of Harry Potter, the following chapter will first of all briefly define the concept of genre in general, give a short explanation of how genres can be used in terms of marketing strategies and of how they can influence the reader. The main emphasis of the essay will be on the following three chapters that are more or less constructed equally and contain in each case one of the above-mentioned genres. In the first part of each chapter, the genre will be defined and examined according to its origins, followed by an analysis of the main characteristics that constitute each genre. Subsequently, the characteristics of each genre will be analysed within Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, to show that Rowling’s book series actually incorporates the different genres. Finally, it will be illustrated, how the three different genres affect the reader, leading to the fascination of the novels. As the fantasy genre influences all the others, this genre will be presented first and the most extensive, followed by the folktale and ultimately the school story.",['Foreign Language Study']

Critique and Utopia in Postcolonial Historical Fiction,['Greg Forter'],"This bold and ambitious volume argues that postcolonial historical fiction offers readers valuable resources for thinking about history and the relationship between past and present. It shows how the genre's treatment of colonialism illustrates continuities between the colonial era and our own and how the genre distils from our colonial pasts the evanescent, utopian intimations of a properly postcolonial future. Critique and Utopia in Postcolonial Historical Fiction arrives at these insights by juxtaposing novels from the Atlantic world with books from the Indian subcontinent. Attending to the links across these regions, the volume develops luminous readings of novels by Patrick Chamoiseau, J. G. Farrell, Amitav Ghosh, Marlon James, Hari Kunzru, Toni Morrison, Marlene van Niekerk, Arundhati Roy, Kamila Shamsie, and Barry Unsworth. It shows how these works not only transform our understanding of the colonial past and the futures that might issue from it, but also contribute to pressing debates in postcolonial theory—debates about the politics of literary forms, the links between cycles of capital accumulation and the emergence of new genres, the meaning of 'working through' traumas in the postcolonial context, the relationship between colonial and panoptical power, the continued salience of hybridity and mimicry for the study of colonialism, and the tension between national liberation struggles and transnational forms of solidarity. Beautifully written and meticulously theorized, Critique and Utopia in Postcolonial Historical Fiction will be of interest to students of world literature, Marxist critics, postcolonial theorists, and thinkers of the utopian.",['Literary Criticism']
Conflict and Colonialism in 21st Century Romantic Historical Fiction,"['Hsu-Ming Teo', 'Paloma Fresno-Calleja']","This book explores how postmillennial Anglophone women writers use romantic narrativisations of history to explore, revise, repurpose and challenge the past in their novels, exposing the extent to which past societies were damaging to women by instead imagining alternative histories. The novelists discussed employ the generic conventions of romance to narrate their understanding of historical and contemporary injustice and to reflect upon women’s achievements and the price they paid for autonomy and a life of public purpose. The volume seeks, firstly, to discuss the work of revision or reparation being performed by romantic historical fiction and, secondly, to analyse how the past is being repurposed for use in the present. It contends that the discourses and genre of romance work to provide a reparative reading of the past, but there are limitations and entrenched problems in such readings.",['Literary Criticism']

Science Fiction and the Historical Novel,"['Ian P. MacDonald', 'Kate Polak']","If you woke to realize that you could rewrite your yesterday without knowing the kind of tomorrow it would grant you, would you do it? Are the authors of our destiny working with an outline or spit-balling confusing plotlines? Since the past changes possible futures, to what alighting butterfly should we pay the most heed? This book explores the liminal space between speculative fiction and the historical novel. Staged as a transnational, multicultural conversation, it takes up a call originally made by Fredric Jameson in Archaeologies of the Future wherein he describes that flashpoint between speculative and historical genres as ""the symptom of a mutation in our relationship to historical time itself."" Drawing together postcolonial, feminist, cultural, Indigenous, and cognitive approaches, Science Fiction and the Historical Novel asks what the past can offer a future-oriented world, and how the future can be imagined in relation to a past that seeks narratives of inevitability rather than possibility. Engaged with the idea of the past as a model for the future, authors in this volume probe the extent to which historical scripts delimit possibilities, and how authors engaged with the practice of alternative pasts rewrite potentialities in the present.",['Literary Criticism']
21st Century US Historical Fiction,['Ruth Maxey'],"This new collection examines important US historical fiction published since 2000.

Individual essays in 21st Century US Historical Fiction: Contemporary Responses to the Past tackle prominent and provocative new novels, for example, recent Pulitzer Prize-winning fiction by Anthony Doerr, Viet Thanh Nguyen and Colson Whitehead. Interrogating such key themes as war, race, sexuality, trauma and childhood; notions of genre and periodization; and recent theorizations of historical fiction, scholars from the United States, Canada, Britain and Ireland analyze an emerging canon of contemporary historical fiction by an ethno-racially diverse range of major American writers.",['Literary Criticism']

"Contemporary Historical Fiction, Exceptionalism and Community",['Susan Strehle'],"This book analyzes a significant group of contemporary historical fictions that represent damaging, even catastrophic times for people and communities; written “after the wreck,” they recall instructive pasts. The novels chronicle wars, slavery, racism, child abuse and genocide; they reveal damages that ensue when nations claim an exalted, exceptionalist identity and violate the human rights of their Others. In sympathy with the exiled, writers of these contemporary historical fictions create alternative communities on the state’s outer fringes. These fictive communities include where the state excludes; they foreground relations of debt and obligation to the group in place of individualism, competition and private property. Rather than assimilating members to a single identity with a unified set of views, the communities open multiple possibilities for belonging. Analyzing novels from Britain, Australia and the U.S., along with additional transnational examples, Susan Strehle explores the political vision animating some contemporary historical fictions.",['Literary Criticism']

"Postmodern, Marxist, and Christian Historical Novels",['Lynne W. Hinojosa'],"Postmodern, Marxist, and Christian Historical Novels: Hope and the Burdens of History argues historical novels can help readers receive the burdens of history—meaning both the burdens of the past, present, and future and the burden of living in time—and develop a more robust conception of and concrete practice of hope. Since the 1960s, historical novels have been a dominant literary genre, but they have been influenced primarily not by Christian but by postmodern and marxist thinkers and writers. This book provides a theological and literary analysis of all three types of historical novels—postmodern, marxist, and Christian—and outlines what each school of thought can learn from each other regarding historical understanding and hope. Using Jürgen Moltmann’s theology of hope and Frank Kermode’s literary criticism as a theoretical basis, the book offers readings of novels by Julian Barnes, A.S. Byatt, Kazuo Ishiguro, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje, Ian McEwan, and Ursula LeGuin, among others, and ends with an extended analysis of Marilynne Robinson’s Gilead series.",['Literary Criticism']
Re-visioning Historical Fiction for Young Readers,['Kim Wilson'],"This study is concerned with how readers are positioned to interpret the past in historical fiction for children and young adults. Looking at literature published within the last thirty to forty years, Wilson identifies and explores a prevalent trend for re-visioning and rewriting the past according to modern social and political ideological assumptions. Fiction within this genre, while concerned with the past at the level of content, is additionally concerned with present views of that historical past because of the future to which it is moving. Specific areas of discussion include the identification of a new sub-genre: Living history fiction, stories of Joan of Arc, historical fiction featuring agentic females, the very popular Scholastic Press historical journal series, fictions of war, and historical fiction featuring multicultural discourses. Wilson observes specific traits in historical fiction written for children — most notably how the notion of positive progress into the future is nuanced differently in this literature in which the concept of progress from the past is inextricably linked to the protagonist’s potential for agency and the realization of subjectivity. The genre consistently manifests a concern with identity construction that in turn informs and influences how a metanarrative of positive progress is played out. This book engages in a discussion of the functionality of the past within the genre and offers an interpretative frame for the sifting out of the present from the past in historical fiction for young readers.",['Literary Criticism']

Victorian Dress in Contemporary Historical Fiction,['Danielle Mariann Dove'],"Victorian Dress in Contemporary Historical Fiction is the first full-length study to investigate and attend to the deeply suggestive and highly symbolic iterations of Victorian women's dress in the contemporary cultural imagination. Drawing upon a range of popular and less well-studied neo-Victorian novels published between 1990 and 2014, as well as their Victorian counterparts, 19th-century illustrative material, and extant Victorian garments, Danielle Dove explores the creative possibilities afforded by dress and fashion as gendered sites of agency and affect. Focusing on the relationship between texts and textiles, she demonstrates how dress is central to the narrativization, re-formulation, and re-fashioning of the material past in the present. In its examination of the narrative trajectories, lively vitalities, and material entanglements that accrue to, and originate from, dress in the neo-Victorian novel, this study brings a fresh approach to reading Victorian sartorial culture. For researchers and students of Victorian and neo-Victorian studies, dress history, material culture, and gender studies, this volume offers a rich resource with which to illuminate the power of fashion in fiction.",['Literary Criticism']

Public History,['Thomas Cauvin'],"Public History: A Textbook of Practice is a guide to the many challenges historians face while teaching, learning, and practicing public history. Historians can play a dynamic and essential role in contributing to public understanding of the past, and those who work in historic preservation, in museums and archives, in government agencies, as consultants, as oral historians, or who manage crowdsourcing projects need very specific skills. This book links theory and practice and provides students and practitioners with the tools to do public history in a wide range of settings. The text engages throughout with key issues such as public participation, digital tools and media, and the internationalization of public history. Part One focuses on public history sources, and offers an overview of the creation, collection, management, and preservation of public history materials (archives, material culture, oral materials, or digital sources). Chapters cover sites and institutions such as archival repositories and museums, historic buildings and structures, and different practices such as collection management, preservation (archives, objects, sounds, moving images, buildings, sites, and landscape), oral history, and genealogy. Part Two deals with the different ways in which public historians can produce historical narratives through different media (including exhibitions, film, writing, and digital tools). The last part explores the challenges and ethical issues that public historians will encounter when working with different communities and institutions. Either in public history methods courses or as a resource for practicing public historians, this book lays the groundwork for making meaningful connections between historical sources and popular audiences.",['History']

Counterfactual historical fiction is a literary genre that comprises narratives set in worlds whose histories run contrary to the history of our world, usually speculating on what would have happened had a significant historical event (such as a war) turned out differently. The author develops a systematic critical approach based on a customised model of Possible Worlds Theory supplemented by cognitive concepts that account for the different processes that readers go through when they read counterfactual historical fiction, a genre which relies heavily on pre-existing knowledge about history and culture. This book will be of interest to anyone working with Possible Worlds, including within the fields of philosophy, literary studies, stylistics, cognitive poetics, and narratology.",['Language Arts & Disciplines']
Alternate History,['Kathleen Singles'],"While, strictly speaking, Alternate Histories are not Future Narratives, their analysis can shed a clear light on why Future Narratives are so different from past narratives.

For the very first time, Alternate Histories are here discussed against the backdrop of their Other, Future Narratives. The volume contains in-depth analyses of the classics of the genre,such as Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle and Philip Roth's The Plot against America, as well as less widely-discussed manifestations of the genre, such as Dieter Kühn's N, Christian Kracht's Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten, and Quentin Tarantino's film Inglourious Basterds.",['Literary Criticism']

A Guide to Historical Fiction (Classic Reprint),['Ernest A. Baker'],"Excerpt from A Guide to Historical Fiction Tales, has written an able defence of the reading of this kind of romance, to which I have little to add except by the way of emphasis. Historical fiction is not history, but it is often better than history. A fine historical painting, a pageant, or a play, may easily teach more and carry a deeper impression than whole Chapters of description and analysis. Esmond and Tom fones are indispensable adjuncts to Lecky. Scott and Dumas will always have a larger history class than any two regular historians you could name. Even a second-rate historical novel may have ample excuse for existence. But a good one - good, that is, merely as a story - though chronology may be at fault and facts inaccurately stated, will probably succeed in making a period live in the imagination when text-books merely give us dry bones.

Fictions of Culture,['Steven A. Taubeneck'],"This volume has two related aims. The first is to honor Walter H.

The second aim is to outline the emerging shape of cultural studies, and to suggest that Walter Sokel's work, especially in the field of intellectual history, has played a decisive role in that transition. This volume illustrates the process of transformation occurring within literary study. The book thus takes a position in the vertiginous debate concerning the purpose of education today. Walter H. Sokel has been a distinguished teacher and researcher at various American universities, including Columbia, Stanford, and the University of Virginia. He has specialized in the study of German intellectual History, Expressionism, and Franz Kafka.",['Art']
Galdos's Novel of the Historical Imagination,['Peter Bly'],"The Spanish writer Benito Pérez Galdós (1843-1920) was a prolific novelist, and ranks with Balzac and Dickens as a chronicler of nineteenth-century society. His 46 historical novels (the episodios nacionales) dealt with the major events of Spanish history in the first half of the nineteenth century. From about 1870 he began to publish contemporary social novels, and in 1881, with La desheredada, he inaugurated what he himself saw as a new style of writing. The novels from 1881 to 1915, his serie contemporánea, are the subject of this study. Professor Bly argues that in them Galdós created a special type of historical novel which, by drawing subtle parallels between fictional action and political events, allegorised the political history of the recent Spanish past. In the earlier novels of the series, the relationship between the fiction and its contemporary background has an allegorical dimension. Historical detail both provides a precise setting for the narrative, and indicates that the fiction represents the national reality, while the leading fictional characters symbolize public figures. The later novels, however, increasingly show disenchantment with Spanish politics, reflected in a diminishing use of historical material and in the emergence of characters who renounce social involvement in favour of the almost mystical pursuit of Christian values. In arguing for this approach to the serie contemporánea, Peter Bly offers perceptive interpretations of all the novels, but devotes particular attention to the masterpieces La de Bringas, Fortunata y Jacinta and Miau. Because the novels relate to the major political trends and events of the period, a brief historical survey of the years 1860-1910 is provided as an appendix.",['History']

Visions of Past Glory,['Derek Fewster'],"Finland, during both prehistoric and medieval times, has been the subject of numerous studies, but none of these have previously considered the nationalist essence of the integral, underlying history culture' or public archaeology' of the nation. Even quite obvious political interpretations, visions, and imageries of an ancient Golden Age have all too easily been dismissed as the consequences of mere patriotism, Kalevala enthusiasm', or Karelianism. This study presents the case for how the conceptions of a distant, glorious past have been advanced and actively developed within the national project of constructing a modern ethnicity of Finnishness. Accordingly, a conception of an original ancient greatness was paramount for the nationalist movements in both the Grand Duchy and the early Republic of Finland, especially so when the perceived nation was considered in need of intellectually unifying defences against the many conceived threats of Russianness after ca 1890. The author traces the construction of a Finnish Great Myth of National Origins from the 16th century until the end of the Second World War, and provides richly illustrated examples of how the process of nation-building influenced and amplified the deep historical core of the emerging Finnish national consciousness.",['History']

The Library-Classroom Partnership,"['Rosann Jweid', 'Margaret Rizzo']","The purpose of The Library-Classroom Partnership is to assist library teachers and classroom teachers to effectively use the library and its resources as an extension of the classroom. As in the earlier edition, the lessons included in this book stress the library media skills needed by individuals for lifelong learning. Long after adults have forgotten a particular fact of history or the techniques of balancing an equation, they continue to use library skills to answer their questions and to meet the demands of an ever-changing society. It has been well documented that the skills taught in a library are most effectively learned within the context of classroom work. To this end, the librarian and the teacher must form a working team to take each other's ideas and develop them into effective learning experiences for students. The authors have incorporated the teaching of those library media skills with every discipline taught in the school. Through these lessons, students will realize that research and reference are a vital part of the learning process, complementing and enriching every subject. The eleven disciplines (English, mathematics, social studies, science, art, music, home and careers, technology, physical education, health, and foreign language) normally taught in the junior high and middle schools are addressed in this work. To be included, a lesson must be a learning experience in both the library skills and the subject areas. Each unit has been cooperatively developed using the expertise of the school library media specialist and the subject teacher. All lessons have been implemented successfully in the junior high and middle school environment. This revised and expanded edition of The Library Classroom- Partnership also deals with technology and the changing economic and social conditions affecting public schools.

Superior Position,['Evan McNamara'],"Former Army sniper Bill Tatum likes his new job. As Deputy Sheriff of Mineral County, Colorado, he gets to ride a horse and wear a cool hat, but he never expected to find a dead woman in the hills behind his cabin. Tatum never expected to find himself on the wrong side of the crosshairs, either. The woman with the bullet hole in her temple was a reporter from the Rocky Mountain News, and her journal reveals secret affairs, political corruption, and a pending environmental disaster. But Tatum has little time to ponder motive, because the bullets are flying. No one is safe from the deadly accurate vengeance of a well-placed rifle bullet. As Tatum muddles through the deception and lies in his once-innocent alpine village, the sniper stays one step ahead of him, killing mercilessly, then disappearing into the Colorado wilderness, eliminating carefully chosen targets with impunity. Tatum cannot overcome the sniper's meticulous planning and penchant for public assassinations. When his suspects fill up the county morgue instead of the jail, Tatum realizes he must fall back on his training as an Army sniper to regain Superior Position and stop the terror from the ridge above.",['Fiction']

Rich & Mysterious: Der Niagara-Fall,['Neal Skye'],"""Ich bin Sara"", sagte sie. ""Sara Maria Anderson"". Ich wusste, das konnte nur ""Problem"" bedeuten. Sie trug ein langes, grünes Satinkleid und hatte keine Ahnung, wer sie in das Taxi gesetzt hatte, das sie nach Buffalo, NY gebracht hatte, direkt in mein Büro. Die letzten acht Stunden und dreißig Minuten waren in ihrem Gedächtnis wie ausradiert, aber schon bald war mir klar, dass wir deutlich tiefer graben mussten. Ein Mord in Saras unmittelbarer Umgebung zog mich dann in die Vergangenheit, in eine Welt aus Skrupellosigkeit und Habgier, gewährte mir aber auch Einblicke in die ungewöhnliche und bizarre Welt zweier bemerkenswerter Frauen. Und welchen Beziehungsstatus hatte wohl diese kleine, italienische Stupsnase vom NYPD? Niclas ""Rich"" Richmond war Ende der 80er Jahre ein junger, gefragter Journalist, der von der renommiertesten Detektei Buffalos abgeworben wurde.

Hannibal for Dinner,"['Kyle A. Moody', 'Nicholas A. Yanes']","NBC's Hannibal only lasted for three seasons but became a critical darling and quickly inspired a ravenous fanbase. Bryan Fuller's adaptation of Hannibal Lecter's adventures created a new set of fans and a cult audience through its stunning visuals, playful characters, and mythical tableaus of violence that doubled as works of art. The show became a nexus point for viewers that explored consumption, queerness, beauty, crime, and the meaning of love through a lens of blood and gore. Much like the show, this collection is a love letter to America's favorite cannibal, celebrating the multiple ways that Hannibal expanded the mythology, food culture, fandom, artistic achievements, and religious symbolism of the work of Thomas Harris. Primarily focusing on Hannibal, this book combines interviews and academic essays that examine the franchise, its evolution, creatively bold risks, and the art of creating a TV show that consumed the hearts and minds of its audience.",['Performing Arts']
Cinematic Worldbuilding,['Nicholas LaRue'],"Everybody has a story in them. Some people lack the language and the tools to tell that story effectively. As an avid tabletop role-playing game player, I’m amazed at people’s ability to tell stories on the spot. Both the players and the game masters are creating worlds in their minds and playing out the events, using improv, in real-time. Being an author and screenwriter, I know how difficult it is to create consistent and well-constructed characters, themes, and conflicts. I believe that storytellers looking to level up in the classroom, their hobby, or career could learn a lot from games like Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, and others. This book seeks to give people the tools and language to create and master their worlds and characters, using TTRPG mechanics and rulesets as foundational elements. This book will contain insights and interviews from some of today’s most respected game masters, players, actual play actors, and we’ll also hear from some of the people behind the scenes responsible for creating these games, and how they view worldbuilding and storytelling for their audiences.",['Computers']

Crime Fiction and National Identities in the Global Age,['Julie H. Kim'],"To read a crime novel today largely simulates the exercise of reading newspapers or watching the news. The speed and frequency with which today's bestselling works of crime fiction are produced allow them to mirror and dissect nearly contemporaneous socio-political events and conflicts. This collection examines this phenomenon and offers original, critical, essays on how national identity appears in international crime fiction in the age of populism and globalization. These essays address topics such as the array of competing nationalisms in Europe; Indian secularism versus Hindu communalism; the populist rhetoric tinged with misogyny or homophobia in the United States; racial, religious or ethnic others who are sidelined in political appeals to dominant native voices; and the increasing economic chasm between a rich and poor. More broadly, these essays inquire into themes such as how national identity and various conceptions of masculinity are woven together, how dominant native cultures interact with migrant and colonized cultures to explore insider/outsider paradigms and identity politics, and how generic and cultural boundaries are repeatedly crossed in postcolonial detective fiction.",['Literary Criticism']

"Climbing Steep Literary Hills, at a Slow Pace",['Chris Maddix'],"Shakespeare. Classic literature. What image does your mind conjure up in response to those daunting words? Quaking fear? Hives? Crushing boredom? Do you harken back to musty, cobweb-adorned memories of high school AP English? Are you recalling your panic days of college, trying to find a way to finish that essential, impossible paper, thinking, “This professor really HAS TO give me an extension”? A friend recently told me that he never read classic literature, even in the times when he was required to read classic literature. The venerable William F. Buckley defined classic literature as something that everyone wished to have read, but that no one wanted to read. Oh my! My response to classic literature is different. I find that reading classics is enjoyable, and I want folks to share my enjoyment of Shakespeare. How? The summaries and plays within this book comprise fifteen of the best works of the greatest author - Shakespeare. I have rewritten and constructed them, however, in such a way that they might be seen as understandable, not overly time-consuming, mostly contemporary, and yes, dare I say it – fun.

Translation Under State Control,['Gaby Thomson-Wohlgemuth'],"In this book, Gaby Thomson-Wohlgemuth explores the effects of ideology on the English-to-German translation of children’s literature under the socialist regime of the former German Democratic Republic. Giving prominence to extra-textual factors, the study undertakes a close investigation of the East German censorship machinery, showing that there was a close correlation between the socialist ideology propagated by the regime and the book selection process itself. Through an analysis of the contents of the print permit (censorship) files and the afterwords found in many books, Thomson-Wohlgemuth demonstrates that literature was re-written not only to placate the censor but also to directly guide the reader down the correct ideological path, both in the selection and interpretation of each translated text. Thomson-Wohlgemuth begins this engaging study with a concise but thorough historical background of East German children's literature, setting the context for an examination of how the state and party operated to control the development of the genre. She highlights the fact that there was multi-level censorship at work, with the Unity Party propagating certain ideological literary policies, and the publishers self-censoring when selecting suitable texts for translation and publication. This book serves as an exemplary study of how publishers collaborated with the state in all Eastern European countries, and should be of interest to historians and children’s literature scholars alike.",['Language Arts & Disciplines']

Cultural Capitalism,['Bradley A. Gorski'],"Cultural Capitalism explores Russian literature's eager embrace of capitalism in the post-Soviet era. When the Soviet Union fell, books were suddenly bought and sold as commodities. Russia's first bestseller lists brought attention and prestige. Even literary prizes turned to the market for legitimacy. The rise of capitalism entirely transformed both the economics and the aesthetics of Russian literature. By reconstructing the market's influence on everything from late-Soviet paper shortages to the prose of neoimperialism, Cultural Capitalism reveals Russian literature's exuberant hopes for and deep disappointments in capitalism. Only a free market, it was hoped, could cure endemic book deficits and liberate literature from ideological constraints. But as the market came to dominate literature, it imposed an ideology of its own, one that directed literary development for decades. Through archival research, original interviews, and provocative readings of literary texts, Bradley A. Gorski immerses the reader in both the economic and aesthetic worlds of post-Soviet Russian literature to reveal a cultural logic dominated by capitalism. The Russian 1990s and early 2000s saw markets introduced, adopted, and debated at an accelerated pace, all against the backdrop of a socialist past, staging the polemics between capitalism and culture in high drama and sharp relief. But the market forces at the center of the post-Soviet transition are fundamental to cultural trends worldwide. By revealing the complexities of Russia's story, Cultural Capitalism mounts a critique that cuts across national borders and provides a new way of seeing culture in the post-1989 era worldwide.",['History']

Free Women (Mujeres Libres),['Laura Ruiz'],"Free Women based their activities upon the dialog, the solidarity and the equality of differences. It was therefore a model for the social movements of the current dialogical societies of the XXIst Century, in which these elements basic are to overcome the social inequalities. Free Women organization was created in the framework of the libertarian movement shortly before the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. It was one of the movements with greatest impact upon the lives of the worker and peasant women. More than twenty thousand women enrolled the organization, almost all of them young women, workers and with no academic education. They got organized in order to overcome what they called the triple slavery of the worker woman: slavery as a woman, slavery as a worker and slavery for the lack of opportunities to gain access to education. They were the main actresses of the complete transformation of their own lives. They didn't only claim for labor and social equality, but they also transformed their personal relationships, love and the sexuality, contributing to the overcoming of a traditional masculinity model based upon power relationships and double standards. Laura Ruiz is a researcher at the University of Barcelona.",['Education']
The Aesthetic Dimensions of Educational Administration & Leadership,"['Eugenie A. Samier', 'Richard Bates']","The question of aesthetics as a theoretical framework for thinking about modern leadership issues in educational settings is an emergent area of inquiry that is receiving considerable attention. There is a growing sense that the mechanistic approach to leadership, which has been widely encouraged over the last ten years, is sterile and that a more philosophical approach is now required. This approach is covered here, taking into account the importance of aesthetics on all aspects of the administrative and leadership world: the ways ideas and ideals are created, how their expression is conveyed, the impact they have on interpersonal relationships and the organisational environment that carries and reinforces them and the moral boundaries or limits that can be established or exceeded. While presenting a significant departure from conventional studies in the field, the international contributors reflect a continuity of thought on administrative and leadership authority, from the writings of Plato through to current theory.",['Education']

Introduction to Brownie (folklore),"['Gilad James, PhD']","Brownie is a household spirit in English and Scottish folklore who is believed to help with household chores if satisfied with food or small gifts. Brownies were first mentioned in Scottish folk tales during the 16th century as small creatures with brown hair and clothing who inhabited houses and performed helpful tasks, such as mending clothes or preparing meals. They were said to be very shy and rarely seen by humans, but their presence could be felt through the completion of tasks left unfinished by household members. Over time, the depiction of brownies in folklore evolved to include magical abilities and a mischievous nature. It was believed they could cause harm to humans if displeased, but they could also use their powers to bring good fortune. The superstition surrounding brownies has become less prominent in modern times, but the concept of small household spirits who provide assistance still persists in various cultures around the world.",['Juvenile Nonfiction']

The Bilingual Method,['Sach Song Ngu'],"In an increasingly globalized world, bilingualism is becoming more common, and research into how the brains of bilingual individuals differ from those of monolinguals is shedding light on its profound cognitive benefits. Far from being a source of confusion, as once believed, the ability to speak two languages actively reshapes the brain, leading to enhanced cognitive functions and a more robust mental landscape. One of the key scientific insights is that both languages known by a bilingual person are always active, even when only one is being used. This constant co-activation means the brain is continuously managing and suppressing the unused language, a process that strengthens cognitive control. This mental juggling act, performed effortlessly by bilinguals, leads to significant advantages in areas such as attention, problem-solving, and task-switching. Research by scholars like Viorica Marian and Ellen Bialystok has demonstrated that bilingual brains exhibit remarkable neural plasticity. When faced with phonological competition (words that sound similar), bilinguals recruit additional frontal control and subcortical regions of the brain. This indicates a more developed and flexible language control system. This enhanced neural network not only helps in managing two languages but also translates into broader cognitive benefits. For instance, attentional control – the ability to focus on relevant information and shift attention as needed – is significantly boosted in bilingual individuals. This improved attentional control is a central aspect of cognitive function throughout life and can even help sustain cognitive function in older age, potentially delaying the onset of conditions like dementia. Furthermore, studies have shown that bilingual children often display greater creativity and flexibility in problem-solving compared to their monolingual peers. This is attributed to their continuous practice in navigating multiple linguistic systems, which fosters a more adaptable and agile mind. The experience of navigating multiple linguistic systems fosters a more adaptable and agile mind. This ebook is designed for a wide range of language learners, from beginners to advanced students, who are looking for an effective and engaging method to accelerate their language acquisition journey. Specifically, this book is for: - Self-directed learners: Individuals who prefer to take control of their learning process and are seeking a structured yet flexible approach to language study. - Frustrated learners: Those who have tried traditional language learning methods without significant success and are open to exploring a new, more intuitive approach. - Intermediate and advanced learners: Students who have a foundational understanding of a target language but wish to deepen their comprehension, expand their vocabulary, and refine their fluency through authentic materials. - Polyglots in the making: Individuals interested in learning multiple languages and seeking a versatile method that can be adapted across different linguistic systems. - Curious minds: Anyone fascinated by the cognitive science behind language acquisition and eager to leverage brain-friendly techniques for more efficient learning. - Parents and educators: Those who are interested in understanding the principles of bilingualism and how to foster language development in children or students. This book is particularly beneficial for those who are motivated, consistent, and willing to actively engage with parallel materials. It provides a comprehensive framework that can be customized to suit individual learning styles and preferences, making it a valuable resource for anyone committed to achieving true bilingual proficiency.",['Education']

Modern Poetry and the Christian Tradition,['Amos N. Wilder'],"In Modern Poetry and the Christian Tradition, Wildler examines this movement in poetry in relation to the direction in which our culture is moving. He interprets the significance of modern poetry and shows its relation to the ""traditional."" He gives attention to the representative poets of our time (including Dylan Thomas, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Allen Tate, W. H. Auden, Wallace Stevens, T. S. Eliot and others); he notes the wider implications of their work and assesses from them the impulses and trends of our age. As a poet of considerable ability, as a student of literary criticism for many years, and as a teacher, Wilder is in a position to know and understand his subject. The result is a book of permanent value to all concerned with the deeper meanings of civilization and Christianity.",['Religion']
Modern Poetry and Ethnography,['S. Heuston'],"This study maps a new approach to the works of W.B. Yeats, Robert Frost, Robert Penn Warren, and Seamus Heaney. Sean Heuston combines interdisciplinary analysis, specifically ethnography, with close reading, and in so doing argues provocatively for the intersection of modern poetry studies and contemporary ethnographic theory.",['Literary Criticism']
The Universal Deep Structure of Modern Poetry,['John A.F. Hopkins'],"With something of a poetry renaissance currently under way worldwide, there is now, more than ever, a need for a solidly-based methodology for interpreting poems: something more empirical than traditional ‘lit-crit’ approaches, and something more linguistically-informed than the version of ‘postmodernism’ rampant in certain Anglophone universities. The latter approach, which tends to allow the individual reader to do what he/she likes with a poetic text, is inadequate to interpret modernist poetry, whose English-language precursors may be found in the late Romantics; its pioneers were already writing (in France) as early as 1840. What is so different about the modernists? Most importantly, their works are monumental, in that they are strongly resistant to deconstruction. Contributing to this resistance is the fact that they are built around two deep-level propositions, each of which generates a set of indirectly-signifying images, sharing the same internal structure, but having a different vocabulary. Thus, they do not signify according to linear narrative, but according to these propositions—and the relation between them—which may be reconstructed by a careful comparison of images on the textual surface. Every text—as subject-sign—refers to an intertextual object-sign, which is usually another poem, but may also be a film or other form of art. Mediating between these two signs is their reader-constructed interpretant, which completes the semiotic triad. As this book shows, the novelty of this sign is thrown into relief by the contrast it makes with a lexical counterpart from the reader’s experience, which differs from the interpretant in structure. The book’s inclusion of French and Japanese, as well as English poems, shows that deep-level signifying mechanisms may well be universal, with considerable research and pedagogical implications.",['Poetry']
Expressivity in Modern Poetry,['Donald Wellman'],"Expressivity in Modern Poetry explores three interrelated subjects. The first is a general exposition of the radical or deeply realistic aspects of the poetry and visual arts of the modem period. The focus is on the works of Ezra Pound as understood through a prism of postmodern thought. The second subject is the poetry and poetics of Charles Olson, a pivotal figure during the transition from modernism to postmodemism. The third subject is contemporary innovative poetry with special attention to transcultural, neobarroco, and language-centered aspects of composition. The grounding for this section is found in the works of William Carlos Williams, Aime Cesaire, and Jose Lezama Lima. A reversal of the relation between the center and periphery-decentering the New York-to-Paris vector-is crucial for understanding the Caribbean as a seedbed for both innovative and identity-based poetics. Wellman's purpose is to amplify the cultural importance of expressivity in a field where critical discussion is often dominated by constructivism and conceptualism. Expressivity in Modern Poetry offers a new reading of the relation between twentieth-century modernism and contemporary poetic practice.",['Literary Criticism']
Aberration in Modern Poetry,"['Lucy Collins', 'Stephen Matterson']","This critical work considers the role played by elements that might be considered aberrational in a poet's oeuvre. With an introductory essay exploring the nature of aberration, these fourteen contributions investigate the work of major 20th-century poets from the U.S., Britain, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Aberration is considered from the standpoint of both the artist and the audience, prompting discussion on a range of important issues, including the formation of the canon. Each essay discusses the status of the aberrant work and the ways in which it challenges, enlarges or supports the overall perception of the poet.",['Literary Criticism']
The Modern Element: Essays on Contemporary Poetry,['Adam Kirsch'],"A collection of bold, insightful, and controversial essays by “a poetry critic of the very first order” (New York Times). Over the last ten years, through essays in The New Republic, The New Yorker, and other magazines, Adam Kirsch—“one of the most promising young poet-critics in America” (Los Angeles Times)—has established himself among the most controversial and fearless critics writing today. Sure to cause heated debate, this collection of essays surveys the world of contemporary poetry with boldness and insight, whether Kirsch is scrutinizing the reputation of popular poets such as Billy Collins and Sharon Olds or admiring the achievement of writers as different as Derek Walcott, Czeslaw Milosz, and Frederick Seidel. For readers who want an introduction to the complex world of contemporary American poetry, from major figures like Jorie Graham to the most promising poets of the younger generation, Kirsch offers close readings and bold judgments. For readers who already know that world, The Modern Element will offer a surprising and thought-provoking new perspective.",['Literary Criticism']
"Power, Plain English, and the Rise of Modern Poetry",['David Rosen'],"DIVIn this engaging book David Rosen offers a radically new account of Modern poetry and revises our understanding of its relation to Romanticism. British poets from Wordsworth to Auden attempted to present themselves simultaneously as persons of power and as moral voices in their communities. The modern lyric derives its characteristic complexities—psychological, ethical, formal—from the extraordinary difficulty of this effort. The low register of our language—a register of short, concrete, native words arranged in simple syntax—is deeply implicated in this story. Rosen shows how the peculiar reputation of “plain English” for truthfulness is employed by Modern poets to conceal the rift between their (probably irreconcilable) ambitions for themselves. With a deep appreciation for poetic accomplishment and a wonderful iconoclasm, Rosen sheds new light on the innovative as well as the self-deceptive aspects of Modern poetry. This book alters our understanding of the history of poetry in the English language./div",['Literary Criticism']

The Columbia Companion to Modern East Asian Literature,['Joshua S. Mostow'],"This extraordinary one-volume guide to the modern literatures of China, Japan, and Korea is the definitive reference work on the subject in the English language. With more than one hundred articles that show how a host of authors and literary movements have contributed to the general literary development of their respective countries, this companion is an essential starting point for the study of East Asian literatures. Comprehensive thematic essays introduce each geographical section with historical overviews and surveys of persistent themes in the literature examined, including nationalism, gender, family relations, and sexuality. Following the thematic essays are the individual entries: over forty for China, over fifty for Japan, and almost thirty for Korea, featuring everything from detailed analyses of the works of Tanizaki Jun'ichiro and Murakami Haruki, to far-ranging explorations of avant-garde fiction in China and postwar novels in Korea. Arrayed chronologically, each entry is self-contained, though extensive cross-referencing affords readers the opportunity to gain a more synoptic view of the work, author, or movement. The unrivaled opportunities for comparative analysis alone make this unique companion an indispensable reference for anyone interested in the burgeoning field of Asian literature. Although the literatures of China, Japan, and Korea are each allotted separate sections, the editors constantly kept an eye open to those writers, works, and movements that transcend national boundaries. This includes, for example, Chinese authors who lived and wrote in Japan; Japanese authors who wrote in classical Chinese; and Korean authors who write in Japanese, whether under the colonial occupation or because they are resident in Japan. The waves of modernization can be seen as reaching each of these countries in a staggered fashion, with eddies and back-flows between them then complicating the picture further. This volume provides a vivid sense of this dynamic interplay.",['Literary Criticism']
The Selling and Self-Regulation of Contemporary Poetry,['J.T. Welsch'],"The Selling and Self-Regulation of Contemporary Poetry is the first book-length study of the contemporary poetry industry. By documenting radical changes over the past decade in the way poems are published, sold, and consumed, it connects the seemingly small world of poetry with the other, wider creative industries. In reassessing an art form that has been traditionally seen as free from or even resistant to material concerns, the book confronts the real pressures – and real opportunities – faced by poets and publishers in the wake of economic and cultural shifts since 2008. The changing role of anthologies, prizes, and publishers are considered alongside new technologies, new arts policy, and re-conceptions of poetic labour. Ultimately, it argues that poetry’s continued growth and diversification also leaves individuals with more responsibility than ever for sustaining its communities.",['Literary Criticism']

Penguin Modern Poets 4,"['Don Paterson', 'Nick Laird', 'Kathleen Jamie']","Other Ways to Leave the Room features the work of three of the most beloved and lauded poets currently at large. Between them, Kathleen Jamie, Don Paterson and Nick Laird write lyrical, luminous and often darkly witty poems about the rugged wildness of the Scottish landscape; about fatherhood; about whisky-drinking, alcohol abuse and tenement life; about sex, love and the pursuit of the spiritual; about childhood in the Ireland of the Troubles, and about the strange possibilities of the technological future. What all three have in common is an ability to combine observations of gritty real life with a sense of the mythical proportions always lurking just under the surface of the everyday.

Welsh Environments in Contemporary Poetry,['Matthew Jarvis'],"Welsh Environments in Contemporary Poetry’ examines the question of how recent English-language poetry from Wales has responded to the diverse physical environments of Wales. The first volume to offer a sustained assessment of Welsh poetry in English within the context of recent developments in environmental literary criticism, this book also draws on aspects of human geography to explore the rich contemporary poetics of Welsh space and place. Opening with an examination of poets from the 1960s as well as the early work of R.S. Thomas, ‘Welsh Environments in Contemporary Poetry’ subsequently concentrates on the poetry of writers who have come to prominence since the 1970s: Gillian Clarke, Ruth Bidgood, Robert Minhinnick, Mike Jenkins, Christine Evans, and Ian Davidson.Close reading of key texts reveals the way in which these writers variously create Welsh places, landscapes, and environments – fashioning rural and urban spaces into poetic geographies that are both abundantly physical and inescapably cultural. Far from reducing Wales to mere scenery, the poetry that emerges from this book engages with the environments of Wales, not just for their own sake, but as a crucial way of exploring key issues in Welsh culture – from the negotiation of female identity in a land of masculine myths to the exploration of Welsh space in a global context.",['Literary Criticism']

These volumes respond to a need for a collective and multifarious view of literary modernism in various genres, locations, and languages.

While the chief emphasis of these volumes is on literary modernism, literature is seen as entering into diverse cultural and social contexts.

Poetic Modernism in the Culture of Mass Print,['Bartholomew Brinkman'],"How scrapbooking, book collecting, and other ways of handling print media informed modernist poetry. In Poetic Modernism in the Culture of Mass Print, Bartholomew Brinkman argues that an emerging mass print culture conditioned the production, reception, and institutionalization of poetic modernism from the latter part of the nineteenth century through the middle of the twentieth century—with lasting implications for the poetry and media landscape. Drawing upon extensive archival research in the United States and Britain, Brinkman demonstrates that a variety of print collecting practices—including the anthology, the periodical, the collage poem, volumes of selected and collected poems, and the modern poetry archive—helped structure key formal and institutional sites of poetic modernism. Brinkman focuses on the generative role of book collecting practices and the negotiation of print ephemera in scrapbooks. He also traces the evolution of the modern poetry archive as a particular case of the mid-twentieth-century rise of literary archives and identifies parallels between the beginning of mass print culture at the end of the nineteenth century and the growth of digital culture today. Advocating for a transatlantic modernism that stretches roughly from 1880 to 1960—one that incorporates both popular and canonical poets—Brinkman successfully extends the geographical, historical, and vertical dimensions of modernist studies. Poetic Modernism in the Culture of Mass Print will appeal not only to scholars and students of literary modernism, modern periodical studies, book history, print culture, media studies, history, art history, and museum studies but also to librarians, archivists, museum curators, and information science professionals.",['Literary Criticism']
The Figure of the Animal in Modern and Contemporary Poetry,['Michael Malay'],"This book argues that there are deep connections between ‘poetic’ thinking and the sensitive recognition of creaturely others. It explores this proposition in relation to four poets: Marianne Moore, Elizabeth Bishop, Ted Hughes, and Les Murray. Through a series of close readings, and by paying close attention to issues of sound, rhythm, simile, metaphor, and image, it explores how poetry cultivates a special openness towards animal others. The thinking behind this book is inspired by J. M. Coetzee’s The Lives of Animals. In particular, it takes up that book’s suggestion that poetry invites us to relate to animals in an open-ended and sympathetic manner. Poets, according to Elizabeth Costello, the book’s protagonist, ‘return the living, electric being to language’, and, doing so, compel us to open our hearts towards animals and the claims they make upon us. There are special affinities, for her, between the music of poetry and the recognition of others. But what might it mean to say that poets to return life to language? And why might this have any bearing on our relationship with animals? Beyond offering many suggestive starting points, Elizabeth Costello says very little about the nature of poetry’s special relationship with the animal; one aim of this study, then, is to ask of what this relationship consists, not least by examining the various ways poets have bodied forth animals in language.",['Literary Criticism']

It examines the poem in the archive and in the digital sphere, as well as in relation to decolonization and global capitalism.

Twentieth-Century Metapoetry and the Lyric Tradition,['Daniella Jancsó'],"Twentieth-Century Metapoetry and the Lyric Tradition reveals the unique value of metapoems for exploring twentieth-century poetry. By placing these texts into a hitherto barely investigated literary-historical perspective, it demonstrates that modern metapoetry is steeped in the lyric tradition to a much greater extent than previously acknowledged. Since these literary continuities that cut across epochal boundaries can be traced across all major poetic movements, they challenge established accounts of the history of twentieth-century poetry that postulate a radical break with the (immediate) past. Moreover, the finding that metapoems perpetuate traditional forms and topoi distinguishes metapoetry historically and systematically from metafiction and metadrama. After highlighting the most important differences as regards to the function of metareference in poetry on the one side, and in fiction and drama on the other, the book concludes with a discussion of how to account for these generic differences theoretically. With its ""extraordinarily subtle and perceptive"" (Ronald Bush, St. John's College, Oxford) interpretive readings of over one hundred metapoems by canonical anglophone authors, it offers the first representative selection of twentieth-century poems about poetry in English.",['Literary Criticism']

Typography can make or break a page, can enhance or overpower an image, and can obscure a message or bring it into sharp focus. It is one of the most powerful tools in the graphic designer’s arsenal, and Typographic Design is the complete, practical introduction.",['Architecture']
The Alvarez Generation,['William Wootten'],"This book is the biography of a taste in poetry and its consequences. During the 1950s and 1960s, a generation of poets appeared who would eschew the restrained manner of Movement poets such as Philip Larkin, a generation who would, in the words of the introduction to A. Alvarez’s classic anthology The New Poetry, take poetry ‘Beyond the Gentility Principle’. This was the generation of Thom Gunn, Geoffrey Hill, Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath and Peter Porter. William Wootten explores what these five poets shared in common, their connections, critical reception, rivalries and differences, and locates what was new and valuable in their work. The Alvarez Generation is an important re-evaluation of a time when contemporary poetry and its criticism had a cultural weight it has now lost and when a ‘new seriousness’ was to become closely linked to questions of violence, psychic unbalance and, most controversially of all, suicide. A new Afterword contains important biographical information on Sylvia Plath and reflects on its implications both for the discussions contained in the book and for the study of Plath’s work more generally.",['Biography & Autobiography']

Mina Loy,['Jennifer R. Gross'],"A richly illustrated exploration of Mina Loy’s art and writings Mina Loy (1882–1966) was one of the most iconoclastic figures in modernism. A groundbreaking poet, she also left an indelible mark in painting, drawing, prose, art criticism, and fashion. Mina Loy: Strangeness Is Inevitable is the first book to examine the full scope of her extraordinary career, demonstrating Loy’s transformative impact on the visual arts as well as the literary avant-garde of the twentieth century. Presenting dozens of Loy’s paintings, drawings, and constructions alongside selections of her poems and writings, this book gives a comprehensive overview of the complex images and objects Loy created and situates them in the larger context of her life and work. It explores Loy’s pursuit of truth and beauty, arguing that her engagement with the emphatically “unbeautiful” materials of the Bowery—such as rags and bottle caps—reflects her questioning of truth. The book positions Loy within the broader context of surrealist art; sheds light on her relationships with influential figures such as Gertrude Stein, Marcel Duchamp, and Wyndham Lewis; and addresses Loy’s enduring relevance today. Featuring rare and previously unpublished artworks, Mina Loy: Strangeness Is Inevitable reveals this visionary artist’s extraordinary contributions as an image-maker, writer, and cultural arbiter, introducing her work to a new generation of readers and charting new directions in art history, women’s studies, poetry, and modernist studies.

Skeptical Music,['David Bromwich'],"Skeptical Music collects the essays on poetry that have made David Bromwich one of the most widely admired critics now writing. Both readers familiar with modern poetry and newcomers to poets like Marianne Moore and Hart Crane will relish this collection for its elegance and power of discernment. Each essay stakes a definitive claim for the modernist style and its intent to capture an audience beyond the present moment. The two general essays that frame Skeptical Music make Bromwich's aesthetic commitments clear. In ""An Art without Importance,"" published here for the first time, Bromwich underscores the trust between author and reader that gives language its subtlety and depth, and makes the written word adequate to the reality that poetry captures. For Bromwich, understanding the work of a poet is like getting to know a person; it is a kind of reading that involves a mutual attraction of temperaments. The controversial final essay, ""How Moral Is Taste?,"" explores the points at which aesthetic and moral considerations uneasily converge. In this timely essay, Bromwich argues that the wish for excitement that poetry draws upon is at once primitive and irreducible. Skeptical Music most notably offers incomparable readings of individual poets. An essay on the complex relationship between Hart Crane and T. S. Eliot shows how the delicate shifts of tone and shading in their work register both affinity and resistance. A revealing look at W. H. Auden traces the process by which the voice of a generation changed from prophet to domestic ironist. Whether discussing heroism in the poetry of Wallace Stevens, considering self-reflection in the poems of Elizabeth Bishop, or exploring the battle between the self and its images in the work of John Ashbery, Skeptical Music will make readers think again about what poetry is, and even more important, why it still matters.",['Literary Collections']
"Italy's ultramodern, experimental lyrics",['Justin Vitiello'],"This anthology of Corpo 10 poets includes some of the «brightest lights» on today's Italian cultural scene. These new voices resonate with linguistic originality and, at the same time, enflesh Pier Paolo Pasolini's idea of poetry: a process of critical and radical revisioning of the world, the sine qua non in the remaking of a genuine culture. Translated with a firm grasp of meaning, rhythm, musicality, verbal idiosyncrasies and poetic nuances by one of their fellow-innovators, these poets come alive in the American idiom. In his critical introduction, the translator also analyzes and affirms the significance of their ground-breaking work in the context of the post-WWII Italian «politics of experimental poetic movements».",['Foreign Language Study']

Women and Death,['Beth A. Bassein'],Bassein examines the pervasive linkage between women's sexuality and death in Western thought and literature and concludes that there is no reasonable basis for much of it. She first explores how language reveals and reinforces the bond between women and death. She then discusses traditional Christianity as a vehicle for perpetuating this tie and demonstrates that negative attitudes and brutality associated with women find expression in otherwise commendable works of art. The author examines nineteenth- and twentieth-century fiction and poetry to show the different ways writers have handled women in sexual situations. Bassein concludes that tracing the origins and prevalence of the automatic association and seeking alternatives help us recognize the irrational and unconscious tendencies that are at the basis of stereotype formation and tacit acceptance of brutality.,['Family & Relationships']

Poetic Argument,['Jonathan Kertzer'],"Beginning with an essay on the history and theory of poetic argument, he traces its patterns through Romantic and Modernist literature. He divides his subject into three areas: the paradoxes of reason, language, and argument. Poetic Argument surveys the writings of the five poets in light of what has to be ""proved"" and identifies the characteristic styles of proof for each. For example, in the chapter on Marianne Moore, Kertzer studies two expressions of poetic argument. The first regards poetry as a waking dream, combining the powers of sleep and calculation. The second, derived from Imagism, treats poetry as a special way of seeing. Kertzer suggests that the combination of these two elements produces Moore's characteristically intricate, but inconclusive, forms of argument.",['Literary Criticism']
Female Heroes in Young Adult Fantasy Fiction,['Leah Phillips'],"The heroic romance is one of the West's most enduring narratives, found everywhere, from religion and myth to blockbuster films and young adult literature. Within this story, adolescent girls are not, and cannot be, the heroes. They are, at best, the hero's bride, a prize he wins for slaying monsters. Crucially, although the girl's exclusion from heroic selfhood affects all girls, it does not do so equally- whiteness and able-bodiedness are taken as markers of heightened, fantasy femininity. Female Heroes in Young Adult Fantasy Fiction explores how the young female-heroes of mythopoeic YA, a Tolkienian-inspired genre drawing on myth's world-creating power and YA's liminal potential, disrupt the conventional heroic narrative. These heroes, such as Tamora Pierce's Alanna the Lioness, Daine the Wildmage, and Marissa Meyer's Cinder and Iko, offer a model of being-hero, an embodied way of living and being in this world that disrupts the typical hero's violent hierarchy, isolating individuality, and erasure of difference. In doing so, they push the boundaries of what it means to be a hero, a girl, and even human.",['Literary Criticism']
Understanding (Post)feminist Girlhood Through Young Adult Fantasy Literature,['Elizabeth Little'],"Understanding (Post)feminist Girlhood Through Young Adult Fantasy Literature takes advantage of growing critical interest in popular young adult texts and their influence on young people. The monograph offers an innovative approach by pairing traditional literary analysis with the responses of readers to show the complex ways that young people respond to the depiction of female protagonists. In the first section, the book utilises a feminist framework to examine young adult fantasy novels published from 2012 to 2018, with a particular focus on A Court of Thorns and Roses (Maas, 2015) and Red Queen (Aveyard, 2015). The analysis shows how strong female protagonists in young adult fantasy are postfeminist heroines who reinscribe patriarchal power structures, embrace limited understandings of gender roles, and persist in relationships that oppress them. In the second section, the monograph introduces empirical data from a series of focus groups discussing those same novels. The discussion shows that readers respond to these popular young adult fantasy texts with complexity and nuance that highlights their postfeminist subjectivities as they simultaneously reject and reinscribe elements of postfeminism in their understanding of the girl protagonists.",['Young Adult Fiction']
Animals in Young Adult Fiction,['Walter Hogan'],"Of the many themes occurring in young adult literature, one that bears more extensive exploration is the adolescent-animal connection. Although substantial critical commentary has addressed children's animal stories and animals in adult fiction, very few studies have been devoted to adolescent-animal encounters. In Animals in Young Adult Fiction, Walter Hogan examines several hundred novels and stories to explore the ways in which animals are represented in these works. In additional to providing an historical survey, Hogan looks at both realistic fiction and speculative works, including fantasy, supernatural, horror, and science fiction. Hogan reviews stories that feature wild animal encounters, stories centered on relationships with horses, dogs, and other working and performing animals, and those featuring relationships with pets. Drawing upon established scholarship, this book examines human-animal relationships from multiple angles, making it an invaluable resource for librarians, teachers, and students of children's and young adult literature.",['Juvenile Nonfiction']
Inclusive Young Adult Fiction,['Melanie Ramdarshan Bold'],"This book examines ‘diversity’, or the lack thereof, in young adult fiction (YA) publishing. It focuses on cultural hegemony in the United Kingdom and explores how literary culture aimed at young adults reproduces and perpetuates ‘racial’ and ethnic cultural hierarchies. Diversity is described by the We Need Diverse Books project as ‘all diverse experiences, including (but not limited to) LGBTQIA, Native, people of color, gender diversity, people with disabilities, and ethnic, cultural, and religious minorities’. This study focuses on people of colour. While previous studies have looked at the representation of ethnic minorities in books for children and young adults, this book examines the experiences of ‘own voice’ cultural producers that create a counter-narrative. Specifically, this book will investigate the output and experiences of British young adult fiction authors of colour (BAME authors) published in the UK during the period 2006-2016, drawing upon semi-structured interviewswith a sample of authors.",['Literary Criticism']
Young Adult Fantasy Fiction,['Kim Wilkins'],"Young adult fantasy (YA fantasy) brings together two established genres - young adult fiction and fantasy fiction - and in so doing amplifies, energises, and leverages the textual, social, and industrial practices of the two genres: combining the fantastic with adolescent concerns; engaging passionate online fandoms; proliferating quickly into series and related works.

Nordic Speculative Fiction,"['Jyrki Korpua', 'Aino-Kaisa Koistinen', 'Hanna-Riikka Roine', 'Marta Mboka Tveit']","This volume brings together scholarly theories and practices on speculative fiction from the Nordic countries, including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, that are all rooted in similar values, culture, and history yet are independent and unique societies. The book exhibits both the convergences and the diversity of the Nordics in fiction and fandom as well as in research. It traces the roots of Nordic speculative fiction, how it has developed over time, and how the changes in Nordic environments and societies caused by overhanging shared global issues – such as climate change, mass migration, and technological acceleration – find space in speculative practices. The first of its kind, this book allows for deeper insights into the unique characteristics that make Nordic literature and art recognisable and allows for a better understanding of the place of the Nordics within wider global culture systems. The chapters range from literary critiques, film and television studies, creative works by three Nordic creative writers, transcultural text comparisons, and contributions on speculative art to theoretical and methodological discussions on fandom, worldbuilding, and semantics. Part of the Studies in Global Genre Fiction series, this book contributes to connecting Nordic speculative fiction scholarship to the wider global community within the field. It will be of interest to scholars and general enthusiasts of speculative fiction and those with interest in Nordic fiction; film and television studies; literary, culture, or media studies; comparative literature; and cultural history or art-based research.",['Fiction']

Dort wird sie nun frühmorgens vom Hahn geweckt und soll ihren Großeltern, die praktisch Fremde für sie sind, auf der Farm helfen. Belinda langweilt sich fast zu Tode.

When Worlds Begin: A Collection of Four Young Adult Fantasy Novels,"[""Megan O'Russell""]","Enjoy When Worlds Begin, a collection of four series-starter novels, ranging from epic fantasy to dystopian paranormal romance, from YA author Megan O'Russell. Romance. Magic. Danger. Impossible odds. Enter When Worlds Begin, and dive into four full fantasy novels. Each world is different. Each story is built to whisk you away. A boy whose love is stronger than magic. He'll save the girl who holds his heart, no matter the cost. An assassin with the courage to topple kingdoms. They shouldn't have let her live. She will be the one to end them all. A girl who clings to hope at the end of the world. She didn't know the safety she lived in was a lie. The monsters are the only ones she can trust. An orphan finds adventures that reach new realms. She knew she was a witch. No one warned her that magic would force her into battle. All of these adventures wait for you. If you need romance, crave adventure, and aren't afraid to leap into a new world, When Worlds Begin is the four-book collection for you. When Worlds Begin includes Ember and Stone, Girl of Glass, The Tethering, and The Girl Without Magic. Readers rave about the four novels included in the When Worlds Begin boxset. “I really enjoyed this novel! It’s on the same level as The Hunger Games.” – BookBub Review of Girl of Glass “It's the magic we loved in Harry Potter, but happening right here and right now in the US.” – Amazon review of The Tethering “This reminded me of Doctor Who, except from the standpoint of the Doctor's assistant.” – Goodreads Review of The Girl Without Magic “David fights Goliath that will pass the Bechdel Test!” – Amazon review of Ember and Stone Ember and Stone (Ena of Ilbrea, Book One) Ena never hoped for a peaceful life. She never dreamt she'd become a killer either. After her home is reduced to ash, Ena is swallowed by a world of secrets and magic. Legends warned of dark shadows hiding in the mountains. They didn't warn of the dangers of falling in love with a myth. Girl of Glass (Girl of Glass, Book One) The world is ending, but Nola has been chosen to survive. This young adult dystopian novel looks at the apocalypse from the point of view of one of the few who has been chosen to survive. Blended with romance and a hint of paranormal, Girl of Glass asks the reader what the obligation of the privileged is to help the suffering. The Tethering (The Tethering, Book One) A dark spell may separate them forever. When fate binds Jacob and Emilia together, war threatens to destroy all they hold dear. Wizards are under attack, and Jacob and Emilia find themselves at the center of a battle that will decide the survival of magic. Facing an enemy that can shatter their souls, will they find love or be devoured by flames? The Girl Without Magic (The Chronicles of Maggie Trent, Book One) Death would have been easier, but the Siren wasn't through with her. The Siren dragged Maggie Trent out of a battle and into her Realm, a land where secrets hide in the shadows and pleasure comes at a price Maggie is unwilling to pay. With the promise of adventure in new worlds, Maggie leaps into a journey of blood and romance. *** When Worlds Begin is a four-book, series-starter collection for YA readers who love paranormal romance but just can't decide which of Megan's series to read first/next! The four young adult novels in When Worlds Begin all feature strong female main characters, runaways, hidden worlds, societal oppression, class differences, women in fiction, and, of course, all the adventure you could ask for! So, whether you're in the mood for witchcraft and wizardry, feminism in fantasy―be it urban or epic―myths and legends, or dystopian darkness hiding behind a utopian façade, When Worlds Begin has something for everyone! *** When Worlds Begin is perfect for fans of Kami Garcia, Rick Riordan, Missy Sheldrake, Anthea Sharp, J. C. Gilbert, Meg Collette, and TR Cameron.",['Young Adult Fiction']

Deadly Secrets,['Avril Sabine'],"Some secrets are too dangerous to keep. Others are too dangerous to tell. ***This is a bundled edition of the following stories.*** Earth Bound Elf Sight Assassins Of The Dead 1: Dark Blade Earth Bound Nineteen-year-old Brianne has always dreamed of leading a squad. The one thing she has no control over is holding her back. Like the Caelians' mortal enemies, the Terstens, she's earth bound. Sacred Law demands her death by her twentieth birthday. Twenty-one year old Talon is the son of the Terstens' General. Three years ago he quit the army. He can't tell anyone why he abandoned his life long dream. His secret could end the lives of him and his family. Both societies revolve around their armies, believing the other race caused the centuries long war. When circumstances bring Brianne and Talon together, they start to learn the real truth may lie beyond the Feronian Mountains, which haven't been crossed in centuries. Elf Sight Seeing what's hidden can endanger lives. Seventeen-year-old Shadow thinks their country is in bad shape if her Pa is considered one of their greatest heroes. To her he's the bitter man she has to escape before he learns the secret she's kept her entire life. Getting away, with the help of her brother Irlan, is meant to simplify things. Instead, they become involved in plots against the royal family, hidden identities and magic-wielding enemies. Assassins Of The Dead 1: Dark Blade Some heroes work in the shadows, only their deeds remembered. Meikah's family are templars, as far from necromancers as it's possible to be. When she learns that not only can she see the dead, but also wield magic, she fears what the future holds. She doesn't want to become a necromancer, or a dark blade, but there seems to be few choices now available to her. It doesn't help that people have begun to treat her like she's an evil necromancer and rumours have started. Nor does she believe Kellan when he says she belongs with the Assassins Of The Dead. They seem to be a mismatched group that include nobles, an assassin, a sorcerer, a shapeshifter and a vampire. Not at all like templars. And if she was to join them, the rumours will never end and her family might actually disown her. These stories were written by an Australian author using Australian spelling.

Ryann Carroll has just run into the guy who saved her life ten years ago. You might think she'd be happy to see him again. Not exactly. She's a bit underdressed (as in skinny-dipping) and he's ...not supposed to exist. After her father's affair, all Ryann wants is to escape the family implosion fallout and find a little peace. She also wouldn't mind a first date that didn't suck, but she's determined not to end up like her mom: vulnerable, betrayed, destroyed. Ryann's just moved into her grandma's house in rural Mississippi, the same place where ten years earlier she became lost in the woods overnight and nearly died. She's still irresistibly drawn to those woods. There she encounters the boy who kept her from freezing to death that long ago winter night and was nowhere to be seen when rescuers arrived. He's still mysterious, but now all grown-up and gorgeous, too. And the more she's with him, the greater the threat he poses to Ryann's strict policy-- never want someone more than he wants you. Lad knows the law of his people all too well: Don't get careless and Don't get caught. It's allowed his race to live undetected in this world for thousands of years, mentioned only in flawed and fading folklore. Lad's never been able to forget about Ryann since that night ten years ago. When he sees her again, his fascination re-ignites and becomes a growing desire that tempts him to break all the rules. He's not even supposed to talk to a human, much less fall in love with one. And the timing is atrocious. The Assemblage is coming, the rift between the Light and Dark is widening. Lad may have to trade his own chance at happiness to keep the humans, especially Ryann, blissfully ignorant and safe. **This starter set contains HIDDEN DEEP and HIDDEN HEART, Books One and Two of the saga that created a global fandom.

I need you to know that I care about you, too. So much that it hurts."" Book One, Seeker's World: On her seventeenth birthday, Vega Sloane receives a strange and puzzling gift: a key in the shape of a dragon's head, along with a note that claims she's destined to save the world. When the handsome and mysterious Callum Drake enters her life, she finds herself inextricably drawn to him, and more questions begin to arise. Who is the boy beyond the exquisite façade and charming smile? Vega soon discovers that she's being recruited to attend a magical Academy in a world beyond her own--a school where those known as the Blood-Born train and compete to see who comes out on top. The only problem? Everyone seems to want her dead. Book Two, Seeker's Quest: I was alone with no heroic prince racing to save me, no merciful lord to offer me a stay of execution, and only myself to rely on. I could only hope that this time, I would be enough. Vega Sloane's brother and best friend have been taken, and it's up to her to bring them back to the safety of their own world. But what seems like a simple rescue mission quickly turns into something far more perilous than Vega could ever have imagined. Trapped in a place where nothing is quite as it seems, she can't help but wonder if she'll ever find her way back to the Academy, to the strange new friends she's met...and to the mysterious boy who has captured her heart. In her first encounter with the Usurper Queen, Vega learns that she's not the only one with family secrets. Then again, some secrets are best left unsaid.Seeker's Quest is the second book in the Seeker's World Series. Book Three, Seeker's Fate: With Vega Sloane's return to Fairhaven comes the beginning of her senior year at Plymouth High. Which, of course, means friends, parties, and drama.

It was the characteristic of Esterwood the Land of Forests. Everything was still. It was like calm before the storm. It portended evil. Suddenly the forest seemed to come alive. An eerie sound came and surrounded them. Wind blew violently; they could not stand on their feet. The tree branches wildly swayed in that wind. The trees and creepers were suddenly moving from their positions. The trees seemed to be closing in on the four friends with their branches. They indeed were. The four friends came to a standstill, and looked in all directions to ward off danger. The trees picked up speed. They closed in from all directions. Naren, and his friends Bulli Mantrik, and Answer the Lamb were all caught in the branches of the trees, and were unable to move. Penny the Parrot tried to fly away. The trees chased him, jumped, and caught him with their branches. Naren tried to move, but the trees and creepers so tightly clasped him, he could not move even an inch. So he could not lay hands on his sword. He felt suffocated by a twig holding him tightly by the neck. The trees seemed to kill them all, suffocating to death. An even queerer thing happened.

PSYCHOTHERAPY,['HUGO MÜNSTERBERG'],"This volume on psychotherapy belongs to a series of books which I am writing to discuss for a wider public the practical applications of modern psychology. The first book, called ""On the Witness Stand,"" studied the relations of scientific psychology to crime and the law courts. This new book deals with the relations of psychology to medicine. Others discussing its relations to education, to social problems, to commerce and industry will follow soon. For popular treatment I divide applied psychology into such various, separated books because they naturally address very different audiences. That which interests the lawyer does not concern the physician, and again the school-teacher has his own sphere of interests. Moreover the different subjects demand a different treatment. The problems of psychology and law were almost entirely neglected. I was anxious to draw wide attention to this promising field and therefore I chose the form of loose popular essays without any aim towards systematic presentation of the subject. As to psychology and medicine almost the opposite situation prevails. There is perhaps too much talk afloat about psychotherapy, the widest circles cultivate the discussion, the magazines[Pg viii] overflow with it. The duty of the scientific psychologist is accordingly not to stir up interest in this topic but to help in bringing this interest from mere gossip, vague mysticism, and medical amateurishness to a clear understanding of principles. What is needed in this time of faith cures of a hundred types is to deal with the whole circle of problems in a serious, systematic way and to emphasize the aspect of scientific psychological theory. Hence the whole first part of this book is an abstract discussion and its first chapters have not even any direct relation to disease. I am convinced that both physicians and ministers and all who are in practical contact with these important questions ought to be brought to such painstaking and perhaps fatiguing inquiry into principles before the facts are reached. To those who seek a discussion of life facts alone, the whole first part will of course appear to be a tedious way around; they may turn directly to the second and third parts. One word for my personal right to deal with these questions, as too much illegitimate psychotherapeutics is heard to-day. For me, the relation between psychology and medicine is not a chance chapter of my science to which I have turned simply in following up the various sides of applied psychology. And still less have I turned to it because it has become the fashion in recent years. On the contrary, it has been an important factor in all my work since my student days. I have been through five years of regular medical studies, three years in Leipzig and two years[Pg ix] in Heidelberg; I have an M.D. degree from the University of Heidelberg. In my first year as docent in a German university twenty years ago, I gave throughout the winter semester before several hundred students a course in hypnotism and its medical application. It was probably the first university course on hypnotism given anywhere. Since that time I have never ceased to work psychotherapeutically in the psychological laboratory. Yet that must not be misunderstood. I have no clinic, and while by principle I have never hypnotized anyone for mere experiment's sake but always only for medical purposes, yet I adjust my practical work entirely to the interests of my scientific study. The limitations of my time force me to refuse the psychotherapeutic treatment of any case which has not a certain scientific interest for me, and of the many hundreds whom I have helped in the laboratory, no one ever had to pay anything. Thus my practical work has strictly the character of laboratory research. The chief aim of this book is twofold. It is a negative one: I want to counteract the misunderstandings which overflood the whole field, especially by the careless mixing of mental and moral influence. And a positive one: I want to strengthen the public feeling that the time has come when every physician should systematically study psychology, the normal in the college years and the abnormal in the medical school. This demand of medical education cannot be postponed any longer. The aim of the book is not to fight the Emmanuel Church Movement, or[Pg x] even Christian Science or any other psychotherapeutic tendency outside of the field of scientific medicine. I see the element of truth in all of them, but they ought to be symptoms of transition. Scientific medicine should take hold of psychotherapeutics now or a most deplorable disorganization will set in, the symptoms of which no one ought to overlook to-day.",['Fiction']

Understanding (post)feminist Girlhood Through Young Adult Fantasy Literature,['Elizabeth Little'],"""Understanding (Post)feminist Girlhood Through Young Adult Fantasy Literature takes advantage of growing critical interest in popular young adult texts and their influence on young people. The monograph offers an innovative approach by pairing traditional literary analysis with the responses of readers to show the complex ways that young people respond to the depiction of female protagonists. In the first section the book utilises a feminist framework to examine young adult fantasy novels published from 2012-2018, with a particular focus on A Court of Thorns and Roses (Maas 2015) and Red Queen (Aveyard 2015). The analysis shows how strong female protagonists in young adult fantasy are postfeminist heroines who reinscribe patriarchal power structures, embrace limited understandings of gender roles, and persist in relationships that oppress them. In the second section the monograph introduces empirical data from a series of focus groups discussing those same novels. The discussion shows that readers respond to these popular young adult fantasy texts with complexity and nuance that highlights their postfeminist subjectivities as they simultaneously reject and reinscribe elements of postfeminism in their understanding of the girl protagonists""--",['Fantasy fiction']

Chivalric Stories as Children's Literature,['Velma Bourgeois Richmond'],"Knights and ladies, giants and dragons, tournaments, battles, quests and crusades are commonplace in stories for children. This book examines how late Victorians and Edwardians retold medieval narratives of chivalry--epics, romances, sagas, legends and ballads. Stories of Beowulf, Arthur, Gawain, St. George, Roland, Robin Hood and many more thrilled and instructed children, and encouraged adult reading. Lavish volumes and schoolbooks of the era featured illustrated texts, many by major artists. Children's books, an essential part of Edwardian publishing, were disseminated throughout the English-speaking world. Many are being reprinted today. This book examines related contexts of Medievalism expressed in painting, architecture, music and public celebrations, and the works of major authors, including Sir Walter Scott, Tennyson, Longfellow and William Morris. The book explores national identity expressed through literature, ideals of honor and valor in the years before World War I, and how childhood reading influenced 20th-century writers as diverse as C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Siegfried Sassoon, David Jones, Graham Greene, Ian Fleming and John Le Carre.",['Literary Criticism']

Irish Children's Literature and Culture,"[""Keith O'Sullivan"", 'Valerie Coghlan']","What constitutes a ‘national literature’ is rarely straightforward, and it is especially complex when discussing writing for young people in an Irish context. Until recently, there was only a slight body of work that could be classified as ‘Irish children’s literature’ (whatever the parameters) in comparison with Ireland’s contribution to adult literature in the twentieth century. This volume looks critically at Irish writing for children from the 1980s to the present, examining the work of many writers and illustrators and engaging with all the major forms and genres. Topics include the gothic, the speculative, picturebooks, poetry, post-colonial discourse, identity and ethnicity, and globalization. Modern Irish children’s literature is also contextualized in relation to Irish mythology and earlier writings, thereby demonstrating the complexity of this fascinating area. The contributors, who are leading experts in their fields, examine a range of texts in relation to contemporary literary and cultural theory, and also in relation to writing for adults, thereby inviting a consideration of how well writing for a young audience can compare with writing for an adult one. This groundbreaking work is essential reading for all interested in Irish literature, childhood, and children’s literature.",['Literary Criticism']

The Reality - Fiction Opposition in Children's Literature,['Adrian Zagler'],"Bachelor Thesis from the year 2010 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 1, University of Graz, language: English, abstract: Since the 1970s, scholarly interest in children's literature has grown, and numerous studies looking into the complexity and thematic and structural depth of the texts have been published. Simultaneously, the notion of metareferentiality has sparked interest among scholars from various disciplines. Metareferentiality, though not unique to the twentieth and the twenty-first centuries, is said to be one of the key cultural phenomena of our time. And yet, these two fields of interest, namely children's literature and metareferentiality, have only very rarely been studied in the same context. Metareferential elements in children's books are often seen as phenomena of dream worlds. Thus, they allow a traditional, non-critical reading in which the metareferential elements do not necessarily trigger medial awareness in the readers but can be explained logically and within the framework of the represented story worlds. Consequently, the epistemological status of reality would not be threatened by these texts. However, as this paper aims to prove, such a reading (for instance) of the Alice-stories, Die Unendliche Geschichte and The Book of Lost Things, although undeniably possible, falls short of the true scope of the texts. As will be shown, all four books address the question of the status of fiction with reference to its opposition to reality, albeit in different ways. In their treatment of the subject, they are clearly metafictional texts with epistemological and ontological concerns that require experienced readers to fully grasp their messages. Nevertheless, they are still publicly perceived as children's literature and are enjoyed by children and adults alike. After some general remarks on the genre of children's literature and on metareferentiality, this paper focuses on a particular form of metarefere",['Language Arts & Disciplines']
Ethics and Children's Literature,['Claudia Mills'],"Exploring the ethical questions posed by, in, and about children’s literature, this collection examines the way texts intended for children raise questions of value, depict the moral development of their characters, and call into attention shared moral presuppositions. The essays in Part I look at various past attempts at conveying moral messages to children and interrogate their underlying assumptions. What visions of childhood were conveyed by explicit attempts to cultivate specific virtues in children? What unstated cultural assumptions were expressed by growing resistance to didacticism? How should we prepare children to respond to racism in their books and in their society? Part II takes up the ethical orientations of various classic and contemporary texts, including 'prosaic ethics' in the Hundred Acre Wood, moral discernment in Narnia, ethical recognition in the distant worlds traversed by L’Engle, and virtuous transgression in recent Anglo-American children’s literature and in the emerging children’s literature of 1960s Taiwan. Part III’s essays engage in ethical criticism of arguably problematic messages about our relationship to nonhuman animals, about war, and about prejudice. The final section considers how we respond to children’s literature with ethically focused essays exploring a range of ways in which child readers and adult authorities react to children’s literature. Even as children’s literature has evolved in opposition to its origins in didactic Sunday school tracts and moralizing fables, authors, parents, librarians, and scholars remain sensitive to the values conveyed to children through the texts they choose to share with them.",['Literary Criticism']

Reading Biography,['Carl Rollyson'],"Most book reviewers know very little about the history or the art of biography. Indeed, if there is any art in biography, it is the rare reviewer that acknowledges it or knows how to discuss it. Usually the reviewer regards biography as an occasion to wax eloquent about what he or she thinks of the subject. Little space, if any, is devoted to the biography's structure or style, to the biographer's peculiar problems, or to how the biography relates to others about the same subject. Carl Rollyson, a professional biographer and weekly columnist (On Biography) for The New York Sun, explores the ramifications of authorized and unauthorized biographies, investigates the relationship between biography and history, biography and fiction, biography and autobiography, as well commenting on certain perennial biographical subjects such as Napoleon, on sub genres such as children's biography, and on the most recent developments in life writing. Rollyson's aim is to reach not merely scholars but that vast general audience addicted to reading biography, enhancing their pleasure by providing insight (or you might say, the inside word) on how biographies are put together.",['Biography & Autobiography']
British Biography,['Carl Rollyson'],"Biography as a literary genre is largely the product of the eighteenth century and of one seminal work, James Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson (1791). Boswell's innovations revolutionized the genre and made it the target of suppression and censorship. He sought not only to memorialize a great man but also to reveal his flaws. Boswell reported long stretches of Johnson's conversation, noted his mannerisms, and in general gave an intimate picture such as no biography had ever before dared to attempt. After Boswell, there was a retreat from his bolder innovations, which amounted to self-censorship on the biographer's part. When Thomas Carlyle's biographer, James Anthony Froude, braved this trend against truth and allowed his subject's dark side to show, he was vilified in the press. The tensions between discretion and candor have endured in British biography since Froude, a point Carl Rollyson makes in the reviews of contemporary British biographers he includes in British Biography, which also contains Johnson's full-length biography of Richard Savage, excerpts from Boswell's Life of Johnson as well selections from and commentaries on Southey's biography of Nelson, Mrs. Gaskell's biography of Charlotte Bront, and the revolutionary work of Froude and Strachey.",['Biography & Autobiography']

Each text is accompanied by a commentary placing its contribution in critical context. Ideal for use in undergraduate seminars, this reader may also be of interest for academic researchers in the areas of literary studies and history aiming to get an overview of historical questions in biographical theory. This revised and updated English language edition also includes new translations of texts by J. G.

A Companion to Literary Biography,['Richard Bradford'],"An authoritative review of literary biography covering the seventeenth century to the twentieth century A Companion to Literary Biography offers a comprehensive account of literary biography spanning the history of the genre across three centuries. The editor – an esteemed literary biographer and noted expert in the field – has encouraged contributors to explore the theoretical and methodological questions raised by the writing of biographies of writers. The text examines how biographers have dealt with the lives of classic authors from Chaucer to contemporary figures such as Kingsley Amis. The Companion brings a new perspective on how literary biography enables the reader to deal with the relationship between the writer and their work. Literary biography is the most popular form of writing about writing, yet it has been largely neglected in the academic community. This volume bridges the gap between literary biography as a popular genre and its relevance for the academic study of literature. This important work: Allows the author of a biography to be treated as part of the process of interpretation and investigates biographical reading as an important aspect of criticism Examines the birth of literary biography at the close of the seventeenth century and considers its expansion through the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries Addresses the status and writing of literary biography from numerous perspectives and with regard to various sources, methodologies and theories Reviews the ways in which literary biography has played a role in our perception of writers in the mainstream of the English canon from Chaucer to the present day Written for students at the undergraduate level, through postgraduate and doctoral levels, as well as academics, A Companion to Literary Biography illustrates and accounts for the importance of the literary biography as a vital element of criticism and as an index to our perception of literary history.",['Biography & Autobiography']

The Seductions of Biography,"['David Suchoff', 'Mary Rhiel']","The Seductions of Biography is an important volume which sheds new light on a flourishing literary form, the biography. In postmodern culture, new methods and intentions emerge, as well as new obstacles, towards our understanding of biography as a genre. This book provides a thorough exploration of this genre, from a wide range of postmodern perspectives. The Seductions of Biography brings together a number of essays which reflect in culturally critical as well as autobiographical terms on current themes and practices of contemporary biography. Issues addressed by these essays focus on the postmodern dilemma itself--as new voices from excluded communities make themselves heard in biographical works, the decentralization of new issues, such as gender, ethnicity, and sexuality, becomes problematic. Contributors question the responsibilities a biographer has, both to the subject and the public, and consider also questions of morality and taste; for example, is it fair to use private tapings made by your subject's analyst? And how much do we really need to know about Eleanor Roosevelt's sex life? The impact of sexuality on our reading of public figures is addressed, as well as other issues which explore the popular and provocative nature of biography. Interdisciplinary and wide-ranging in scope, The Seductions of Biography will appeal to biographers, historians, cultural critics, and the vast population of avid biography readers.

Biography and the Question of Literature in France,['Ann Jefferson'],"This book takes a fresh look at the relations between literature and biography by tracing the history of their connections through three hundred years of French literature. The starting point for this history is the eighteenth century when the term 'biography' first entered the French language and when the word 'literature' began to acquire its modern sense of writing marked by an aesthetic character. Arguing that the idea of literature is inherently open to revision and contestation, Ann Jefferson examines the way in which biographically-orientated texts have been engaged in questioning and revising definitions of literature. At the same time, she tracks the evolving forms of biographical writing in French culture, and proposes a reappraisal of biography in terms not only of its forms, but also of its functions. Although Ann Jefferson's book has powerful theoretical implications for both biography and the literary, it is first and foremost a history, offering a comprehensive new account of the development of French literature through this dual focus on the question of literature and on the relations between literature and biography. It offers original readings of major authors and texts in the light of these concerns, beginning with Rousseau and ending with 'life-writing' contemporary authors such as Pierre Michon and Jacques Roubaud. Other authors discussed include Mme de Stäel, Victor Hugo, Sainte-Beuve, Barbey d'Aurevilly, Baudelaire, Nerval, Mallarmé, Schwob, Proust, Gide, Leiris, Sartre, Genet, Barthes, and Roger Laporte.",['Literary Criticism']
Auto/Biography across the Americas,['Ricia A. Chansky'],"Auto/biographical narratives of the Americas are marked by the underlying themes of movement and belonging. This collection proposes that the impact of the historic or contemporary movement of peoples to, in, and from the Americas—whether chosen or forced—motivates the ways in which identities are constructed in this contested space. Such movement results in a cyclical quest to belong, and to understand belonging, that reverberates through narratives of the Americas. The volume brings together essays written from diverse national, cultural, linguistic, and disciplinary perspectives to trace these transnational motifs in life writing across the Americas. Drawing on international scholars from the seemingly disparate regions of the Americas—North America, the Caribbean, and Latin America—this book extends critical theories of life writing beyond limiting national boundaries. The scholarship included approaches narrative inquiry from the fields of literature, linguistics, history, art history, sociology, anthropology, political science, pedagogy, gender studies, critical race studies, and indigenous studies. As a whole, this volume advances discourse in auto/biography studies, life writing, and identity studies by locating transnational themes in narratives of the Americas and placing them in international and interdisciplinary conversations.",['Literary Criticism']

Towards a Poetics of Literary Biography,['Michael Benton'],"Drawing upon a wide range of biographies of literary subjects, from Shakespeare and Wordsworth to William Golding and V.S. Naipaul, this book develops a poetics of literary biography based on the triangular relationships of lives, works and times and how narrative operates in holding them together. Biography is seen as a hybrid genre in which historical and fictional elements are imaginatively combined. It considers the roles of story-telling, factual data in the art of life-writing, and the literariness of its language. It includes a case study of the biography of Ellen Terry, discussion of the controversial relationship between a subject's life and works, 'biographical criticism' and, through the issue of gender, the social and cultural changes biographies reflect. It frames a poetics on the basis of its strategy and tactics and demonstrates how the literal truth of verifiable data and the poetic truth of what is narrated are interdependent.",['Fiction']

Matuschek examines three major phases in the life of the world-famous Austrian author-his years of apprenticeship, his years of success as a professional working writer in Salzburg, and finally his years of exile in Britain, the USA and Brazil. Including the sort of personal detail conspicuously absent from Zweig's memoir, and incorporating newly discovered documents, Matuschek's biography offers us a privileged view into the private world of the master of psychological insight.",['Biography & Autobiography']
Garbo,['John Bainbridge'],"There is only one Garbo, and this is her only definitive biography. Acclaimed by the critics-and a best seller- in its original version, it has now been brought up to the present, and beautifully illustrated with one hundred thirty-two memorable photographs. The result: an even more fascinating study of one of the screen's true immortals. In a period spanning less than two decades, from 1925 to 1941, this shy, working-class girl from Stockholm, the possessor of the face of the century, made twenty-four films, and became the most famous actress in the world. She also became one of its great ornaments and excitements and objects of wonder-""the unapproachable goddess,"" said Alistair Cooke, ""of the most widespread and remarkable mythology in human history."" As a consequence, she found herself the victim of more fatuous and hysterical journalism than any other personality on earth. Mercilessly hounded by the public and press at every turn, she developed an intense aversion to publicity that contributed to making the world's most beautiful woman into one of its loneliest. ""I never said, 'I want to be alone, '"" Garbo told a friend. ""I only said, 'I want to be let alone.' There is all the difference."" With sensitivity, wit, and understanding, Mr Bainbridge presents the whole fabulous story from its unlikely beginning through her last picture and into her retirement, which, ironically, Garbo never planned to make permanent. Her life today-her friends, her interests, her haunts-brings this absorbing biography up to the present moment. An appendix, ""The Films of Greta Garbo,"" lists all of her pictures, both European and American, their casts, production credits, and the place and date of the premiere of each--Page 2 and 3 of cover",['Biography & Autobiography']
Hermann Lotze,['William R. Woodward'],"As a philosopher, psychologist, and physician, the German thinker Hermann Lotze (1817–81) defies classification. Working in the mid-nineteenth-century era of programmatic realism, he critically reviewed and rearranged theories and concepts in books on pathology, physiology, medical psychology, anthropology, history, aesthetics, metaphysics, logic, and religion. Leading anatomists and physiologists reworked his hypotheses about the central and autonomic nervous systems. Dozens of fin-de-siècle philosophical contemporaries emulated him, yet often without acknowledgment, precisely because he had made conjecture and refutation into a method. In spite of Lotze's status as a pivotal figure in nineteenth-century intellectual thought, no complete treatment of his work exists, and certainly no effort to take account of the feminist secondary literature. Hermann Lotze: An Intellectual Biography is the first full-length historical study of Lotze's intellectual origins, scientific community, institutional context, and worldwide reception.",['Science']
Julie Andrews,['Richard Stirling'],"An “intelligent and engrossing” biography of the incomparable star of stage and screen, revealing the determination she brought to bear over every obstacle (Mail on Sunday). In My Fair Lady, Julie Andrews had the biggest hit on Broadway. As the title character in Mary Poppins, she won an Academy Award. And, in 1965, The Sound of Music made her the most famous woman in the world and rescued Twentieth Century Fox from bankruptcy. Three years later, the disastrous Star! almost put the studio back under, and the leading lady of both films fell as spectacularly as she had risen. Her movie career seemed to be over. Yet Julie Andrews survived, with what Moss Hart, director of My Fair Lady, called “that terrible British strength that makes you wonder why they lost India.” Victor/Victoria, directed by her second husband, Blake Edwards, reinvented her screen image—but its stage version in 1997 led to the devastating loss of her defining talent, her singing voice. Against all odds, she fought back again, with roles in The Princess Diaries, Bridgerton, and other productions. The real story of bandy-legged little Julia Wells from Walton-on-Thames is even more extraordinary; fresh details of her family background have only recently come to light. This is the first completely new biography of Julie Andrews as artist, wife, and mother in over thirty-five years—combining the author’s interviews with the star and his wide-ranging and riveting research. It is a frank but affectionate portrait of an enduring icon of stage and screen. “An absorbingly extensive study, with glossy photographs and lively quotes bringing the pages alive with the sound of a much-loved musical star.” —Evening Standard",['Biography & Autobiography']
HAMLET,['William Shakespeare'],"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, written by William Shakespeare between 1599 and 1601, is set in Denmark and recounts how Prince Hamlet exacts revenge on his uncle Claudius, who murdered the King, takes the throne and marries Hamlet's mother. Life of William Shakespeare is a biography of William Shakespeare by the eminent critic Sidney Lee. This book was one of the first major biographies of the Bard of Avon. It was published in 1898, based on the article contributed to the Dictionary of National Biography. William Shakespeare (1564 – 1616) was an English poet and playwright, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the ""Bard of Avon"". His extant works, including some collaborations, consist of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, the authorship of some of which is uncertain. Sir Sidney Lee (1859 – 1926) was an English biographer and critic. He was a lifelong scholar and enthusiast of Shakespeare.

Derrida,['Benoît Peeters'],"This biography of Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) tells the story of a Jewish boy from Algiers, excluded from school at the age of twelve, who went on to become the most widely translated French philosopher in the world – a vulnerable, tormented man who, throughout his life, continued to see himself as unwelcome in the French university system. We are plunged into the different worlds in which Derrida lived and worked: pre-independence Algeria, the microcosm of the École Normale Supérieure, the cluster of structuralist thinkers, and the turbulent events of 1968 and after. We meet the remarkable series of leading writers and philosophers with whom Derrida struck up a friendship: Louis Althusser, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean Genet, and Hélène Cixous, among others. We also witness an equally long series of often brutal polemics fought over crucial issues with thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, John R. Searle, and Jürgen Habermas, as well as several controversies that went far beyond academia, the best known of which concerned Heidegger and Paul de Man. We follow a series of courageous political commitments in support of Nelson Mandela, illegal immigrants, and gay marriage. And we watch as a concept – deconstruction – takes wing and exerts an extraordinary influence way beyond the philosophical world, on literary studies, architecture, law, theology, feminism, queer theory, and postcolonial studies. In writing this compelling and authoritative biography, Benoît Peeters talked to over a hundred individuals who knew and worked with Derrida. He is also the first person to make use of the huge personal archive built up by Derrida throughout his life and of his extensive correspondence. Peeters’ book gives us a new and deeper understanding of the man who will perhaps be seen as the major philosopher of the second half of the twentieth century.",['Philosophy']

In this definitive biography—blessed by John le Carré himself—Adam Sisman reveals the man behind the bestselling persona. In John le Carré, Sisman shines a spotlight on David Cornwell, an expert at hiding in plain sight—“born to lying,” he wrote in 2002, “bred to it, trained to it by an industry that lies for a living, practiced in it as a novelist.” Of course, the pseudonym “John le Carré” has helped to keep the public at a distance. Sisman probes Cornwell’s unusual upbringing, abandoned by his mother at the age of only five and raised by his con man father (when not in prison), and explores his background in British intelligence, as well as his struggle to become a writer, and his personal life. Sisman has benefited from unfettered access to le Carré’s private archive, talked to the most important people in his life, and interviewed the man himself at length. Who is John le Carré?

Mary Lincoln: Biography of a Marriage,['Ruth Painter Randall'],"More fascinating than fiction, this is the moving story of the most misunderstood woman in American history... The truth about Mary Lincoln has for nearly a century been hidden under a mountain of myth. They said Lincoln really loved Ann Rutledge. That he had tried to avoid marriage to Mary Todd, that his wife hurt him politically though she drove him to the Presidency, that she embarrassed him financially as well as socially and inflicted on him the agony of adjustment to her psychopathic personality. Now for the first time, the true woman beneath the myth is presented. The veil of legend surrounding Mary Lincoln is torn aside and an entirely new picture of a woman and a marriage emerges. Here, through the eyes of the people who knew the Lincolns, through the long-lost telegrams and letters they sent each other, comes the story of their day-to-day life together. It begins in Springfield, and there, many years later, it ends. But the truth of those years gives evidence to restore Mary Todd Lincoln to her rightful place in history and in the affections of the American people. Acclaimed by the critics... “Never has such a story seemed better worth telling or better told.”—SATURDAY REVIEW “This is an important and definitive volume.”—AMERICAN HISTORY REVIEW “Out of the most searching scrutiny ever leveled on the Lincolns’ family affairs comes the picture of a tempestuous yet essentially happy marriage.”—NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE “This is a very moving book. It is also a nice example of what a first-rate historian can do with a difficult subject.”—THE NEW YORKER “It is a book that can be recommended without reservation: A combination of profound research and fine prose style, it meets both the requirements of the Lincoln scholar and the casual reader who is looking for a truly fascinating story.”—SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE",['History']

Long before the development of modern schools of economic theory, Attwood sought the regulation of business through control of the money supply. He was unsuccessful in his challenge to the Ricardian school, which promised stability through a gold based economy, and died disillusioned.

Once a settler and exploiter of the American Indians, he became their defender, breaking ground for the modern human rights movement.

Jesus of Nazareth a Biography,['George A. Barton'],"Excerpt from Jesus of Nazareth a Biography The life of Jesus Christ is the most important event in the religious history of mankind. The significance of it is eternal. Nowhere else has God revealed his nature. How shall one approach the task of writing an account of it? Most of our knowledge of this wonderful life is derived from the four Gospels, but in many points the Gospels do not agree. They often differ as to the order of events and the occasions which called forth some of the sublimest teaching of the Master. They differ also as to the length of time covered by his ministry. Under these circumstances those who undertake this delicate and sacred task to-day fall into five groups according to their methods of treating the sources. 1. There are those who regard all the Gospels as equally valuable sources of information, and seek as best they can to harmonize their statements. These writers base their chronology of the Gospels, which was written about seventy years after the Crucifixion. This method produces the type of devotional biography of Jesus which has within the last century become conventional. 2. Another group of writers on the life of Jesus may be called the historical school. They seek to use the knowledge of the composition and dates of the Gospels which has been gained by modern study in accordance with the methods of modern historical research.

While Nursi's ideas have been afforded considerable analysis, this book is the first to situate these ideas and his related activities in their historical contexts. Based on the available sources and Nursi's own works, here is a complete and balanced view of this important theologian's life and thought.",['Religion']
Charlotte Von Kirschbaum and Karl Barth,['Suzanne Selinger'],"Charlotte von Kirschbaum and Karl Barth is the first concentrated study of the collaboration of the towering theologian Karl Barth and his secretary and theological assistant for more than three decades, Charlotte von Kirschbaum. Barth always maintained that he could not have produced his theological oeuvre without her. Von Kirschbaum was also his constant companion. Discussion of the two has long been aswirl in rumor and speculation, with regard both to their personal relationship and to von Kirschbaum's part in Barth's theological achievement. Drawing upon published and unpublished sources that include their own writings, the observations of contemporaries, and correspondence with people who knew them, Suzanne Selinger seeks to describe the collaboration in a multidimensional way. Von Kirschbaum gave a series of lectures in 1949, published in the same year, on women in the perspective of Scripture, theology, and the church. In the three volumes of Barth's Church Dogmatics that deal with humankind, including the male-female relationship as the locus of the image of God, Barth cites von Kirschbaum's scholarship. The subject inevitably reflects upon their own relationship. Moreover, it is just this subject--the anthropology of gender--that has been the source of the categorical rejection of Barth by many feminists. The author--a Barthian, a feminist, and a trained historian--addresses the concerns of Barth's critics by agreeing deeply with them in part but also by insisting upon understanding Barth and von Kirschbaum contextually. This means biographically and in relation to early German feminism (a phenomenon little known in the English-speaking world), the intellectual movement known as dialogical personalism, and the background of everything Barth and von Kirschbaum wrote or thought in their work together: the steady, threatening growth of the Nazi state, World War II, and the postwar German situation.",['Biography & Autobiography']
The Biography of a New Canadian Family,['Pierre L. Delva; Joan Campbell-Delv'],"A Happy and Informative Present: at the new Université de Sherbrooke, Pierre had developed a four-month teaching program for clinical nurses prior to their departure to the Canadian Far North where they would be in charge of a Nursing Station. In 1973, a group of them gave me as a parting gift the French translation of “The Scalpel and the Sword” by Ted Allen and Sydney Gordon (Toronto, 1952); the French version was by Jean Pare, 'Docteur Bethune' (Montreal, 1973). As new Canadians, we thought it odd that the French version should take 20 years to appear on the scene. We had been in Canada for 15 years. In 1975, Pierre's career led him to 1'hospitaldu Sacré-Coeur where Dr. Bethune worked for over three years (1933-1936), his first experience in a non-English environment before going to Spain and China where he died in 1939. He became my last model. During the last seven years of his life Dr Bethune was able to adapt in a masterful way to three completely different important complex situations on three different continents (January 1936 November 1939). On the social side, Joan became secretary of the Montreal-based Norman Bethune Foundation. A year later, Pierre became its fourth Chairman, eventually becoming responsible for a professional exchange program between Montreal and China, working most of the time at the Bethune International Peace Hospital in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province (19891994). Joan was responsible for a TESL program, Pierre for a medical teaching program. Note: Joan is the note-taker, keeping a daily agenda since 1960 without interruptions! Pierre took lots of pictures and accumulated written stuff all classified and in sequence, in about fifty tightly packed binders.",['Biography & Autobiography']

"Tove Jansson Life, Art, Words",['Boel Westin'],"The Finnish-Swedish writer and artist Tove Jansson achieved worldwide fame as the creator of the Moomin stories, written between 1945 and 1970 and still in print in more than twenty languages. However, the Moomins were only a part of her prodigious output. Already admired in Nordic art circles as a painter, cartoonist and illustrator, she would go on to write a series of classic novels and short stories. She remains Scandinavia's best loved author. Tove Jansson's work reflected the tenets of her life: her love of family (and special bond with her mother), of nature, and her insistence on freedom to pursue her art. Love and work was the motto she chose for herself and her approach to both was joyful and uncompromising. If her relationships with men foundered on her ambivalence towards marriage, those with women came as a revelation, especially the love and companionship she found with her long-time partner, the artist Tuulikki Pietilä, with whom she lived on the solitary island of Klovharu. In this meticulously researched, authorised biography, Boel Westin draws together the many threads of Jansson's life: from the studies interrupted to help her family; the dark shades of war and her emergence as an artist with a studio of her own; to the years of Moomin-mania, and later novel writing. Based on numerous conversations with Tove, and unprecedented access to her journals, letters and personal archives, Tove Jansson: Life, Art, Words offers a rare and privileged insight into the world of a writer whom Philip Pullman described, simply, as 'a genius'.",['N/A']

With his subjectÕs complete cooperation (she granted him access to fifty years of personal files), Michael Schuessler provides the first critical biography of PoniatowskaÕs life and work. She is perhaps best known outside of Mexico as the author of Massacre in Mexico (La noche de Tlatelolco) and HereÕs to You, Jesusa! (Hasta no verte, Jesœs m’o). But her body of published books is vast, beginning with the 1954 publication of Lilus Kikus, a collection of short stories. And she is still writing today. Schuessler, who befriended Poniatowska more than fifteen years ago, is a knowledgeable guide to her engrossing life and equally engaging work. As befits her, his portrait is itself a literary collage, a Òliving kaleidoscopeÓ that is constantly shifting to include a multiplicity of voicesÑthose of fellow writers, literary critics, her nanny, her mother, and the writer herselfÑeasily accessible to general readers and essential to scholars.

Nazimova,['Gavin Lambert'],"A forgotten legend, Alla Nazimova was an electrifying Russian-born actress who brought Stanislavksy and Chekhov to American theatre, who was applauded, praised, adored -- an icon of the stage and screen for forty years, before fading into the shadows of time. Gavin Lambert unearthed Nazimova's unpublished memoirs, letters, and notes, writing an evocative retelling of her extraordinary life. Nazimova began her career on stage. Her shockingly natural approach to acting transformed the theatre of her day. She thrilled Laurette Taylor. The first time Tennessee Williams saw her he knew he wanted to be a playwright (""She was so shatteringly powerful that I couldn't stay in my seat""). Eugene O'Neill said of her that she gave him his ""first conception of a modern theatre"". She introduced the American stage and its audience to Ibsen's New Woman, a woman hell-bent on independence. It was a role Nazimova embodied offstage as well. When she toured in a repertory of A Doll's House, The Master Builder, and Hedda Gabler from 1907 to 1910, she earned the then unheard-of sum of five million dollars for theatre manager Lee Shubert. Eight years later she ventured into film, going to Hollywood and signing a contract with Metro Pictures (before it was MGM) and becoming the highest-paid actress in silent pictures, ultimately writing, directing, and producing her own movies ( Revelation, Stronger than Death, Billions, Salome). Nazimova was also a remarkable businesswoman. Four years later she formed her own film company. She was the only actress, other than Mae West, to become a movie star at forty, and was the first to cultivate the image of the ""foreign"" sophisticate, soon to be followed by Pola Negri, Greta Garbo, and Marlene Dietrich. Lambert also delves into Nazimova's complex and dramatic personal life, from her tense relationship with her family to the numerous partners and lovers (both men and women) she had later in life. Nazimova: A Biography is a brilliant re-creation of the life and work of this complex, dark, glamorous, and important figure.",['N/A']

The first of his kind, Namath enabled a nation to see sports as show biz.

Full of Grace,['Terry Golway'],"The death in May 2000 of John Cardinal O'Connor, archbishop of New York, was a vital loss to countless millions. A shining, openhearted crusader for traditional values in an increasingly bewildering culture, O'Connor was a pioneer for the new face of Catholicism, mapping out an unequivocal political and ethical code that stood for unconditional charity, civil liberties, and social justice. His widespread influence and spiritual presence are still felt strongly today. Now, for the first time, one of last century's most inspiring voices for humanity, conscience, and compassion is celebrated and remembered through the words of those who knew him best. Renowned author and journalist Terry Golway shares a diverse collection of intimate stories and accounts: from former New York Mayor Ed Koch, one of the archbishop's closest friends, to fellow clerics he inspired, to all manner of laypersons around the country whose lives were touched and changed by this vital pillar of the Roman Catholic Church. With never-before-seen photographs throughout, along with fascinating, previously unpublished correspondence to and from O'Connor, Full of Grace is a gorgeous tribute and an unprecedented remembrance, affording full access to the vast heart of the extraordinary man who once famously understated, ""I hope that in each place I've gone, I saved some souls.""",['Religion']

Scott of the Antarctic,['David Crane'],"David Crane has given us a magisterial portrait of one of Britain's greatest heroes and explorers, acclaimed as the 'masterpiece' on the subject. Reissued for the 100th anniversary of Scott's doomed expedition. 'It seems a pity, but I do not think I can write more...For God's sake look after our people.' These were the final words written in Scott's diary on 29 March 1912, as he lay dying of exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold, in his tent on his return journey from the South Pole. Since then he has been the subject of many books. Yet in all the pages that have been written about him, the personality behind the legend has been forgotten or distorted beyond all recognition. David Crane's magisterial biography redresses this completely. By reassessing Scott's life and his substantial scientific achievements, Crane is able to provide a fresh and exciting perspective on both the Discovery expedition of 1901-4 and the Terra Nova expedition of 1910-12. The courage and tragedy of Scott's last journey are only one part of the process, for the scientific enquiry that led up to it transformed the whole nature and ambition of Antarctic exploration. Written with the full support of Scott's surviving relatives, and with access to the voluminous diaries and records of key participants, this definitive biography sets out to reconcile the very private struggles of the man with the very public life of extremes that he led.",['Antarctica']

Marcus Aurelius,['Henry Dwight Sedgwick'],"Excerpt from Marcus Aurelius: A Biography Told as Much as May Be by Letters, Together With Some Account of the Stoic Religion and an Exposition of the Roman Government's Attempt to Suppress Christianity During Marcus's Reign In this little book my purpose is to provide those people for whom the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius contain a deep religious meaning, with such introductory information about him, his character, his religion, and his life, as I think, judging from my own experience, they may desire. So I begin with an exposition of Stoic philosophy, and, as I believe that philosophy to have been primarily a religion, I present it as such. And in my defence to sundry criticisms made upon Marcus by ancient and modern writers, I give by far the most space to the gravest, that he persecuted the Christians, for I think no accusation would have surprised him more, or have seemed to him more unreasonable. I have not wished to encumber the pages with notes, and therefore I have relegated to the appendix most references to my authority for statements in the text. Such quotations in a foreign language as have not been translated in the text will be found translated in the appendix. Greek phrases that occur in the letters I have rendered in French.

Michael Tippett,['Oliver Soden'],"'A delight to read' Philip Pullman 'Essential reading ... a genuine landmark publication' Tom Service A BBC Radio 4 'Book of the Week' The music of the British composer Michael Tippett - including the oratorio A Child of Our Time, five operas, and four symphonies - is among the most visionary of the twentieth century. But little has been written about his extraordinary life. In this long-awaited first biography, Oliver Soden weaves a century-spanning narrative of epic scope and penetrating insight. Soden has discovered troves of unpublished letters and manuscripts, and recorded moving interviews with Tippett's friends and colleagues. He paints a portrait of a powerful intellect and infectious personality: charming, stubborn, and great fun. But he also uncovers the sorrows and secrets that Tippett stowed away beneath his cheerfulness, not least the darker reaches of some tempestuous and often tragic love affairs. Soden's achievement is to have enriched our understanding not only of Tippett but of his times. Figures such as T.S. Eliot, E.M. Forster, Barbara Hepworth, and W.H. Auden jostle in the cast list. An Edwardian world of gaslight and empire cedes to turmoil and warfare; one startling revelation is the extent of Tippett's involvement in the fiery left-wing politics of the 1930s. The narrative roves from the mining villages of the north, blighted by unemployment, to a cell at Wormwood Scrubs, where Tippett was imprisoned as a conscientious objector. Later chapters uncover his operas' game-changing attitudes to gay and civil rights, against a backdrop of the Cold War and the Space Race. And singing from the page comes the music, through which Soden charts an exquisitely written course, offering lucid readings of Tippett's most famous works while resuscitating forgotten masterpieces. The result is a landmark in the study of twentieth-century culture, simultaneously an astonishing feat of scholarship and a story as enthralling as in any great novel.",['Composers']
A Statistical Biography of George Udny Yule,['Terence C. Mills'],"""Udny Yule's seminal influence on time series analysis has long been recognized but much less recognized is that Yule was not only a wonderful expositor but that he had also published equally important research in an extraordinarily wide range of fields, from developing the theory of correlation and regression to providing mathematical models of evolutionary behavior, and from analyzing data on pauperism to using statistical methods to resolve cases of disputed authorship of medieval manuscripts.Yet little has been written about Yule and his work, apart from a few scattered articles, since his death in 1951 and the two obituaries that appeared in the following year. This book is an opportune moment to redress the balance and to embark on the first major study of Yule's statistical research and subsequent legacy. Part of the text's title is taken from Yule's 1920 article in the Cambridge Review, 'The wind bloweth where it listeth', where Yule coined the phrase 'loafers of the world' to describe free spirits of academe, who have become an increasingly rare breed in modern university life.Udny Yule was Lecturer, then Reader, in Statistics at Cambridge University, England, from 1912 to 1930. He was a member, then Fellow, of St John's College, at Cambridge Universty, from 1913 until his death in 1951. He was a member of the Royal Statistical Society from 1895 until his death, was awarded the Society's Guy Medal in Gold in 1911, and was President from 1924 to 1926. Yule was awarded a C.B.E. in 1919 for his work during the First World War in the War Office and the Ministry of Food.",['Statisticians']

Flush: a Biography,['Virginia Woolf'],"Flush: A Biography, an imaginative biography of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's cocker spaniel, is a cross-genre blend of fiction and nonfiction.Commonly read as a modernist consideration of city life seen through the eyes of a dog, Flush serves as a harsh criticism of the supposedly unnatural ways of living in the city. The figure of Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the text is often read as an analogue for other female intellectuals, like Woolf herself, who suffered from illness, feigned or real, as a part of their status as female writers. Most insightful and experimental are Woolf's emotional and philosophical views verbalized in Flush's thoughts. As he spends more time with Barrett Browning, Flush becomes emotionally and spiritually connected to the poetess and both begin to understand each other despite their language barriers.",['N/A']

Not his own language, for he has to look in his dictionary, by his own confession, for a word occurring in one of the most important chapters of his Bible; not the commonest traditions of the schools, for he does not know why Poussin was called learned not the most simple canons of art, for he prefers Lee to Gainsborough; not the most ordinary facts of nature, for we find him puzzled by the epithet silver, as applied to the orange-blossom.

A Biography of the Pixel,['Alvy Ray Smith'],"The pixel as the organizing principle of all pictures, from cave paintings to Toy Story. The Great Digital Convergence of all media types into one universal digital medium occurred, with little fanfare, at the recent turn of the millennium. The bit became the universal medium, and the pixel--a particular packaging of bits--conquered the world. Henceforward, nearly every picture in the world would be composed of pixels--cell phone pictures, app interfaces, Mars Rover transmissions, book illustrations, videogames. In A Biography of the Pixel, Pixar cofounder Alvy Ray Smith argues that the pixel is the organizing principle of most modern media, and he presents a few simple but profound ideas that unify the dazzling varieties of digital image making. Smith's story of the pixel's development begins with Fourier waves, proceeds through Turing machines, and ends with the first digital movies from Pixar, DreamWorks, and Blue Sky. Today, almost all the pictures we encounter are digital--mediated by the pixel and irretrievably separated from their media; museums and kindergartens are two of the last outposts of the analog. Smith explains, engagingly and accessibly, how pictures composed of invisible stuff become visible--that is, how digital pixels convert to analog display elements. Taking the special case of digital movies to represent all of Digital Light (his term for pictures constructed of pixels), and drawing on his decades of work in the field, Smith approaches his subject from multiple angles--art, technology, entertainment, business, and history. A Biography of the Pixel is essential reading for anyone who has watched a video on a cell phone, played a videogame, or seen a movie. 400 pages of annotations, prepared by the author and available online, provide an invaluable resource for readers.",['Computers']

With unprecedented access to Wilder's papers, including his family's private journals and records, Niven shows the many sides of this multifaceted man, including his relationship to his two brilliant parents, four gifted siblings, and the specter of his twin brother lost at birth. “Comprehensive and wisely fashioned. . . .

Not only is the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 thrillingly reteold, but Guy Fawkes can now be seen as a multi-faceted figure—husband, soldier, lover, adveturer, spy, and possibly the most misunderstood of English villains.",['Biography & Autobiography']

English literary afterlives,['Elisabeth Chaghafi'],"English Literary Afterlives traces life narratives of early modern authors created for them after their deaths by readers or publishers, who retrospectively tried to make sense of the author’s life and works. In a series of case-studies of the reception history of major poets – Sidney, Spenser, Donne, Herbert, as well as Robert Greene, the first ‘celebrity author’ – within a generation of their deaths, it shows how those authors were posthumously fashioned and refashioned. It argues that during the early modern period there is a gradual movement towards biographical readings that attempt to find the author in the works, which in turn led to the emergence of written lives that consider poets not in terms of their ‘public’ lives but in terms of their poetic activity, i.e. the beginnings of literary biography.

Bernard Buffet,['Nicholas Foulkes'],"It is said that asphyxiation brings on a state of hallucinatory intoxication...in which case the 71 year old artist who lay in his sprawling Provencal villa died happy. In the early afternoon of Monday 4 October 1999, wracked with Parkinson's, and unable to paint because of a fall in which he had broken his wrist, Bernard Buffet calmly placed a plastic bag over his head, taped it tight around his neck and patiently waited the few minutes it took for death to arrive. Bernard Buffet:The Invention of the Modern Mega-artist tells the remarkable story of a French figurative painter who tasted unprecedented critical and commercial success at an age when his contemporaries were still at art school. Then, with almost equal suddenness the fruits of fame turned sour and he found himself an outcast. Scarred with the contagion of immense commercial success no leper was more untouchable. He was the first artist of the television age and the jet age and his role in creating the idea of a post-war France is not to be underestimated. As the first of the so-called Fabulous Five (Francoise Sagan, Roger Vadim, Brigitte Bardot and Yves Saint Laurent) he was a leader of the cultural revolution that seemed to forge a new France from the shattered remains of a discredited and demoralized country. Rich in incident Buffet’s remarkable story of bisexual love affairs, betrayal, vendettas lasting half a century, shattered reputations, alcoholism, and drug abuse, is played out against the backdrop of the beau monde of the 1950s and 1960s in locations as diverse as St Tropez, Japan, Paris, Dallas, St Petersburg and New York, before coming to its miserable conclusion alone in his studio.",['Biography & Autobiography']

After two years in office he became Texas's senior senator and held that position until defeated by John H. Reagan in 1887. Maxey's term of office spanned the turbulent period immediately following Reconstruction, and a great deal of his influence derived from his moderation. He was concerned that the breach caused by the Civil War be healed. He was influential among Republican congressmen from the North and aided substanially in Texas's regaining its status in the Union.

Rowan's Rule,['Rupert Shortt'],"A fascinating, fair-minded depiction of Archbishop Rowan Williams. /Rowan Williams is a complex and controversial figure. Widely revered for his personal qualities, he is also an intellectual giant who towers over almost all his predecessors as Archbishop of Canterbury. Among other achievements, he has trounced the atheist Richard Dawkins, and published over twenty well-regarded books, including several volumes of poetry and a major study of Dostoevsky. / Yet he is also one of the most reviled church leaders in modern history. Long before facing calls to step down after his lecture on sharia law in early 2008, he had been accused of heresy on account of his pro-gay views. He has disappointed many of his own supporters as well. So how has high office changed Rowan Williams? Has he been bullied and manipulated? Or is he perhaps playing a long game, obliged to rate church unity above the pursuit of his own vision at a time when the Anglican Communion has never looked more unstable? / Rupert Shortt, already the author of an acclaimed introduction to the Archbishop's thought, offers answers to these and other questions in this authoritative biography. He explores how the events of the Archbishop's remarkable life have shaped his beliefs and practices today. Of particular interest is the riveting account of Williams's experience near the World Trade Center towers on the morning of September 11, 201. Written with Williams's cooperation, Rowan's Rule not only elucidates his ideas but gives a compelling portrait of a private and in some ways surprisingly vulnerable man.",['Biography & Autobiography']

Four Strong Winds,['John Einarson'],"An acclaimed music historian brings us the long-awaited story of Ian & Sylvia - marking the first time that the legendary folk duo has endorsed a biography of their groundbreaking career. Their classic ""Four Strong Winds"" is widely considered to be one of the great songs of all time. Bob Dylan, Gordon Lightfoot, Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and Joni Mitchell count among their admirers. Their music, including hits like ""You Were On My Mind"" and ""Someday Soon,"" has been recorded by everyone from Dylan, Joan Baez, and Johnny Cash to Sarah McLachlan and The Tragically Hip.

Charles Munch,['D. Kern Holoman'],"A mesmerizing figure in concert, Charles Munch was celebrated for his electrifying public performances. He was a pioneer in many arenas of classical music--establishing Berlioz in the canon, perfecting the orchestral work of Debussy and Ravel, and leading the world to Roussel, Honegger, and Dutilleux. A pivotal figure, his accomplishments put him on a par with Arturo Toscanini and Leonard Bernstein. In Charles Munch, D. Kern Holoman provides the first full biography of this giant of twentieth-century music, tracing his dramatic survival in occupied Paris, his triumphant arrival at the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and his later years, when he was a leading cultural figure in the United States, a man known and admired by Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy. He turned to conducting only in middle age, after two decades as a violinist and concertmaster, a background which gave him special insight into the relationship between conductor and orchestra. At the podium, his bond with his musicians unleashed something in them and in himself. ""A certain magic took wing that amounts to the very essence of music in concert,"" the author writes, as if ""public performance loosed the facets of character and artistry and poetry otherwise muffled by his timidity and simple disinclination to say much."" In concert, Munch was arresting, even seductive, sweeping his baton in an enormous arch from above his head down to his knee. Yet as Holoman shows, he remained a lonely, even sad figure, a widower with no children, a man who fled admirers and avoided reporters. With groundbreaking research and sensitive, lyrical writing, Charles Munch penetrates the enigma to capture this elusive musical titan.",['Biography & Autobiography']

Citizen Trudeau,['Allen George Mills'],"Pierre Elliot Trudeau was a man of deep intellect, of strongly held philosophy, and of bold - if not occasionally audacious - personality. He was no high-minded, distant philosopher-ruler however. A consummate pragmatist, Trudeau sought to be a moral man of action. This important work looks his intellectual evolution as a young man, in the years before he entered politics. Beautifully written, this biography also paints a fascinating, colourful and multilayered portrait of Trudeau. Born into a wealthy family, Trudeau's years among then-Jesuits at Brebeuf College in Montreal were formative, among other reasons for what would become his long-term interaction with Catholicism. Following law school at University of Montreal, Trudeau studied at Harvard in the US, at LSE in London, England, and at Sciences Po in Paris. Mills' considers the biggest influences on Trudeau, including Harold Laski, Jacques Maritain, and Emmanuel Mounier. Mills also recounts Trudeau's travels across the world throughout the 1950s, travelling in Europe, the Near and Far East, Egypt and Sudan, the USSR, Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand, regions in West Africa, Israel, Vietnam, Persia and Taiwan. A chapter considers Trudeau's evolving thought on Federalism and Nationalism, both internationally and in terms of Quebec and Canada. A chapter on Trudeau's moralism highlights his belief that politics requires individuals of conscience, who have the courage to speak frankly about their beliefs. Mills' biography shows us that understanding Trudeau the thinker is key to understanding Trudeau the politician, whose life was both a practical and a theoretical one. He was a cool political thinker who believed that clear analysis of political questions was essential to good governance.",['Biography & Autobiography']

A Field Guide for Science Writers,"['Deborah Blum', 'Mary Knudson', 'Robin Marantz Henig']","This is the official text for the National Association of Science Writers. In the eight years since the publication of the first edition of A Field Guide for Science Writing, much about the world has changed. Some of the leading issues in today's political marketplace - embryonic stem cell research, global warming, health care reform, space exploration, genetic privacy, germ warfare - are informed by scientific ideas. Never has it been more crucial for the lay public to be scientifically literate. That's where science writers come in. And that's why it's time for an update to the Field Guide, already a staple of science writing graduate programs across the country. The academic community has recently recognized how important it is for writers to become more sophisticated, knowledgeable, and skeptical about what they write. More than 50 institutions now offer training in science writing. In addition mid-career fellowships for science writers are growing, giving journalists the chance to return to major universities for specialized training. We applaud these developments, and hope to be part of them with this new edition of the Field Guide. In A Field Guide for Science Writers, 2nd Edition, the editors have assembled contributions from a collections of experienced journalists who are every bit as stellar as the group that contributed to the first edition.

The use of language is key. Based on analyses of popular science bestsellers, this linguistic study shows how expert popularizers use the voices and narratives of scientists to engage readers, demonstrating the power of science and portraying researchers as champions of knowledge.

Learning from the Left,['Julia L. Mickenberg'],"At the height of the Cold War, dozens of radical and progressive writers, illustrators, editors, librarians, booksellers, and teachers cooperated to create and disseminate children's books that challenged the status quo. Learning from the Left provides the first historic overview of their work. Spanning from the 1920s, when both children's book publishing and American Communism were becoming significant on the American scene, to the late 1960s, when youth who had been raised on many of the books in this study unequivocally rejected the values of the Cold War, Learning from the Left shows how ""radical"" values and ideas that have now become mainstream (including cooperation, interracial friendship, critical thinking, the dignity of labor, feminism, and the history of marginalized people), were communicated to children in repressive times. A range of popular and critically acclaimed children's books, many by former teachers and others who had been blacklisted because of their political beliefs, made commonplace the ideas that McCarthyism tended to call ""subversive."" These books, about history, science, and contemporary social conditions-as well as imaginative works, science fiction, and popular girls' mystery series-were readily available to children: most could be found in public and school libraries, and some could even be purchased in classrooms through book clubs that catered to educational audiences. Drawing upon extensive interviews, archival research, and hundreds of children's books published from the 1920s through the 1970s, Learning from the Left offers a history of the children's book in light of the history of the history of the Left, and a new perspective on the links between the Old Left of the 1930s and the New Left of the 1960s.

Celebrating Poetry Across the K-12 Curriculum,"['Napoli, Mary', 'Day, Deanna', 'Ward, Barbara A.']","Poetry provides opportunities to explore the universal and common experiences that connect us as human beings. When teachers infuse poetry into their classroom, it can foster compassion, develop interdisciplinary connections, and support literacy instruction. However, not all teachers use poetry in their classroom either because they are not aware of the value of poetry or because they have not had positive experiences with poetry. Given the importance of sharing poetry with today’s youth, educators must feel confident in evaluating well-written poetry and how to weave poetry from award-winning poets to support interdisciplinary connections. Celebrating Poetry Across the K-12 Curriculum aims to ensure that poetry for children is not neglected as part of the curriculum, and to help educators feel more confident in their understanding of children’s poetry, its relevance to children’s lives, and its importance to supporting pedagogical connections. Featuring interviews with well-known poets, this resource also showcases the latest pedagogical and scholarly research supporting the integration of poetry in the K-12 classroom.

The Well-Trained Mind,"['Susan Wise Bauer', 'Jessie Wise']","Is your child getting lost in the system, becoming bored, losing his or her natural eagerness to learn? If so, it may be time to take charge of your child’s education—by doing it yourself. The Well-Trained Mind will instruct you, step by step, on how to give your child an academically rigorous, comprehensive education from preschool through high school—one that will train him or her to read, to think, to understand, to be well-rounded and curious about learning. Veteran home educators Susan Wise Bauer and Jessie Wise outline the classical pattern of education called the trivium, which organizes learning around the maturing capacity of the child’s mind and comprises three stages: the elementary school “grammar stage,” when the building blocks of information are absorbed through memorization and rules; the middle school “logic stage,” in which the student begins to think more analytically; and the high-school “rhetoric stage,” where the student learns to write and speak with force and originality. Using this theory as your model, you’ll be able to instruct your child—whether full-time or as a supplement to classroom education—in all levels of reading, writing, history, geography, mathematics, science, foreign languages, rhetoric, logic, art, and music, regardless of your own aptitude in those subjects. Thousands of parents and teachers have already used the detailed book lists and methods described in The Well-Trained Mind to create a truly superior education for the children in their care. This extensively revised fourth edition contains completely updated curricula and book lists, links to an entirely new set of online resources, new material on teaching children with learning challenges, cutting-edge math and sciences recommendations, answers to common questions about home education, and advice on practical matters such as standardized testing, working with your local school board, designing a high-school program, preparing transcripts, and applying to colleges.

ACT Math Personal Tutor,['David Ebner'],"Comprehensive Prep for ACT Math. How is this ACT math review book different from other review books? When you thumb through this book, you won't feel defeated right from the start. Other books present solutions in dry and ineffectual manners and in the shortest possible text. They are virtually indistinguishable one from the other. ACT Math Personal Tutor is different for the following reasons: 1) Easy to follow step-by-step solutions for all problems. 2) Cartoons with hints and insights for solving problems are presented in the first two exams to maintain interest and to lighten up the material. Five full-length exams are included. 3) Because it can be rather dull to spend a lot of time reviewing basic math before tackling full-fledged ACT problems, a short review section at the beginning of the book presents just some foundational knowledge of mathematics. Then, in later sections, each problem introduces a new math concept. Through this method ('personal tutoring'), all the math you need for the ACT will be reviewed. 4) Questions are repeated on the answer pages so that you don't have to flip through the pages to get back to the questions.

Harry Potter und die Gesetze der Macht,['Jannina Schäffer'],"Das vorliegende Werk untersucht erstmals die Bezüge zwischen dem deutschen Recht und dem Rechtssystem in den Harry-Potter-Büchern. Es gehört damit zu der aus dem anglo-amerikanischen Rechtsraum stammenden Querschnittsdisziplin ""Law and Literature"". Literarische Werke erschaffen oftmals nicht nur neue fiktive Rechtssysteme, sondern setzten sich häufig auch kritisch mit gesellschaftlichen Problemen auseinander – beides geschieht auf ganz besondere Art und Weise in der Buchreihe von J.K. Rowling. Rowling selbst schafft es wie kaum eine andere Person, eine Welt zu erdenken, die über ein vollständiges politisches System verfügt und nach ihren ganz eigenen Regeln funktioniert. An der Spitze dieser magischen Welt steht das Zaubereiministerium, eine kafkaeske Behörde mit einem aufgeblasenen Bürokratieapparat, die für viel Unrecht verantwortlich ist. Es gelten eigene Gesetze – wie beispielsweise das ""Zaubereiverbot Minderjähriger"" oder das ""Internationale Geheimhaltungsabkommen"", aber auch Gesetze, die Minderheiten wie bspw. Kobolde gezielt diskriminieren. Als Gericht fungiert ein mit Laien besetztes Gremium, der Zaubergamot. Es stellt sich also die Frage: Was sind das für Gesetze, an die sich alle Hexen und Zauberer halten müssen? Welche Besonderheiten gibt es insbesondere im magischen Strafrecht im Vergleich zu unserer Rechtsordnung? Jannina Schäffer begibt sich auf eine fantastische Spurensuche und stellt erstmals das Rechtssystem der Harry-Potter-Welt umfassend dar. Im Rahmen einer rechtsvergleichenden Analyse stellt sie das deutsche Recht dem Recht der Zauberer gegenüber. Dabei bezieht sie auch das historische NS-(Un-)Recht von 1933 bis 1945 in ihre Betrachtung mit ein, denn Parallelen zwischen der Machtergreifung Adolf Hitlers und dem Aufstieg Lord Voldemorts sind in der Literaturwissenschaft allgemein anerkannt. Ein Schwerpunkt des Werks liegt auf dem materiellen und prozessualen Strafrecht sowie der Untersuchung, inwiefern das historische und fiktive (Un-)Recht beiden Diktatoren zur Macht verhalf.",['Law']

Reading Harry Potter Again,['Giselle Liza Anatol'],"Reading Harry Potter Again: New Critical Essays extends the discussion of the Harry Potter books by covering the entire series in one new and comprehensive volume. As was argued in Reading Harry Potter: Critical Essays (Praeger, 2003), interpreting the underlying messages and themes of the Harry Potter series is vital for understanding the ways in which we perceive and interact with each other in contemporary society. The novels and corresponding film adaptations have broken records with their astonishing sales and widespread acclaim. They have also generated a plethora of writing—by critics, academics, and fans. J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books could easily be called this generation's most formative narratives, and thus certainly warrant critical attention. This new volume of essays covers the entire seven-book sequence. Contributors consider myriad themes from a variety of perspectives. Areas addressed include religion, morality, race, magic, and other themes popular in discussing the books. With this book in hand, fans of the series—indeed anyone interested in the Harry Potter phenomenon—will better appreciate and understand Rowling's work and the impact of her stories on our culture and on our times.",['Literary Criticism']

Harry Potter and the Other,"['Sarah Park Dahlen', 'Ebony Elizabeth Thomas']","Named a 2023 Honour Book by the International Research Society for Children's Literature Contributions by Christina M. Chica, Kathryn Coto, Sarah Park Dahlen, Preethi Gorecki, Tolonda Henderson, Marcia Hernandez, Jackie C. Horne, Susan E. Howard, Peter C. Kunze, Florence Maätita, Sridevi Rao, Kallie Schell, Jennifer Patrice Sims, Paul Spickard, Lily Anne Welty Tamai, Ebony Elizabeth Thomas, Jasmine Wade, Karin E. Westman, and Charles D. Wilson Race matters in the fictional Wizarding World of the Harry Potter series as much as it does in the real world. As J. K. Rowling continues to reveal details about the world she created, a growing number of fans, scholars, readers, and publics are conflicted and concerned about how the original Wizarding World—quintessentially white and British—depicts diverse and multicultural identities, social subjectivities, and communities. Harry Potter and the Other: Race, Justice, and Difference in the Wizarding World is a timely anthology that examines, interrogates, and critiques representations of race and difference across various Harry Potter media, including books, films, and official websites, as well as online forums and the classroom. As the contributors to this volume demonstrate, a deeper reading of the series reveals multiple ruptures in popular understandings of the liberatory potential of the Potter series. Young people who are progressive, liberal, and empowered to question authority may have believed they were reading something radical as children and young teens, but increasingly they have raised alarms about the series’ depiction of peoples of color, cultural appropriation in worldbuilding, and the author’s antitrans statements in the media. Included essays examine the failed wizarding justice system, the counterproductive portrayal of Nagini as an Asian woman, the liberation of Dobby the elf, and more, adding meaningful contributions to existing scholarship on the Harry Potter series. As we approach the twenty-fifth anniversary of the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry Potter and the Other provides a smorgasbord of insights into the way that race and difference have shaped this story, its world, its author, and the generations who have come of age during the era of the Wizarding World.",['Literary Criticism']

A significant portion of the book explores the Harry Potter series' literary ancestors, including magic and fantasy works by Ursula K.

Other chapters explore the moral and ethical dimensions of Harry's world, including objections to the series raised within some religious circles. In her new epilogue, Lana A.

Harry Potter and the Myth of Millennials,['Priscilla Hobbs'],"The publication of the Harry Potter series in the United States coincided with the coming-of-age of its main target audience, the millennial generation. Harry Potter and the Myth of Millennials: Identity, Reception, and Politics takes an interdisciplinary view of Harry Potter, as a series and a phenomenon, to uncover how the appeal of Harry became a lifestyle, a moral compass, and a guiding light in an era fraught with turbulence and disharmony. As a new phenomenon at the time, Harry Potter provided comfort through the heroism of the main characters, showing that perseverance and “constant vigilance,” to quote one of the professors, could overcome the darkest of times. Hobbs argues that Harry Potter prepared an entire generation for the chaotic present marked by the 2016 Election and 2020 Pandemic by shaping the political attitudes of its readers, many of whom were developing their political identities alongside Harry. Her analysis focuses on both the novels themselves and the ways in which fans connected globally through the Internet to discuss the books, commiserate about the events swirling around them, and answer calls to action through Harry Potter-inspired activism. In short, Harry Potter and the Myth of Millennials examines how Harry Potter became a generation's defining mythology of love, unity, and transformation.",['Social Science']

Harry Potter’s World Wide Influence,['Diana Patterson'],"The Harry Potter series forms a single epic story that has been published in nearly 70 languages, and has been examined in a large number of disciplines. This collection of essays contributes to the scholarly discourse that forms Potter Studies. These essays take on the consideration of Rowling's work as being worthy of study as a phenomenon and influence, as well as a work of literary value. They add genuine statistical information about the reasons for the books' popularity, consider their effects on child readers, and examine some deep-rooted reasons for their having been manipulated in American publishing, in film adaptations, in musical complements, and in their thingification in popular culture around the world. Some of these essays take on the critics of the books' religion and considerations of psychological, as well as philosophical good and evil, and well as some stylistic anomalies. The fact that scholars from China, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Israel, in addition to English-speaking nations, have felt compelled to examine these books in detail testifies in part to Harry Potter's world-wide influence.",['Literary Criticism']
The Music of Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings,['Daniel White'],"The Music of Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings provides an in-depth study of the music of two of the biggest fantasy franchises, focussing on music’s worldbuilding roles within the film-watching experience and elsewhere in videogames, trailers, plays, theme parks and other attractions, and the world of fandom. Daniel White takes a range of approaches and techniques of motivic and thematic musical analysis, and pairs this with transformational harmonic analysis to theorise music’s worldbuilding roles in film. Chapters focus in turn on the opening sequences of the case study franchise films, their closing sequences, and on their depiction of houses, homes and homelands. Extra-filmic areas of these fantasy worlds are also explored, including theme parks and other tourist attractions of the Harry Potter franchise, videogames and the immersive power of their music, and the world of fandom with a focus on soundtrack consumption and other musical fan practices. Through this multifaceted approach, readers gain a deeper understanding not only of the music of these franchises, but also of music’s power in the multimedia franchise both within and without film to build a home that attracts inhabitants. This book will be valuable for academics and students as well as fans of fantasy franchises.",['Performing Arts']

Harry Potter trifft Gott,['Peter Ciaccio'],"Die Harry-Potter-Bücher gehören zweifellos zum Weltkulturgut. In diesem literarischen Fantasy-Schwergewicht nach Spuren des Christentums zu suchen, klingt zunächst nach einer besonderen Herausforderung. Denn wer Harry Potter kennt, der weiß, dass Religion hier vordergründig keine Rolle spielt. Und trotzdem hat der christliche Glaube einen wichtigen Stellenwert - nicht zuletzt, da die Autorin J. K. Rowling selbst gläubige Christin ist. Peter Ciaccio zeigt in einer höchst interessanten und dabei sehr unterhaltsamen Analyse, welche Motive der Bibel und des christlichen Glaubens in der Romanwelt vorkommen. Das reicht von Harrys Berufung und dessen Verhältnis zu Lord Voldemort über Parallelen zu biblischen Figuren und Märtyrern bis hin zur Überwindung des Bösen durch die Liebe. Ein aufschlussreiches Buch nicht nur für Fans, sondern auch für Kritiker der großen Fantasy-Reihe.",['Religion']

"Der Erlöser im modernen Film: Jugendliche Sinnsuche in ""Harry Potter"" und ""Matrix""",['Raffaello Rossi'],"Die Science-Fiction Trilogie Matrix"" sowie die Fantasy-Saga Harry Potter"" gehoren zu den erfolgreichsten Filmreihen aller Zeiten. Vor allem bei Jugendlichen ist ein regelrechter Hype um diese Filme ausgebrochen. Doch neben immensem Erfolg haben beide Filmreihen wesentlich mehr gemeinsam, so sind sie vollbepackt mit religiosen Momenten, greifen religiose Sehnsuchte der Gesellschaft auf und sind beide durch eine Erloser-Hauptperson gekennzeichnet, die pragnante Parallelen zum biblischen Jesus zeigt. Und genau dieser letzte Punkt konnte verantwortlich fur den enormen Erfolg bei Jugendlichen sein. So mochte dieses Buch beweisen, dass religiose Muster, wie eine Erloserfigur als Protagonist, im modernen Film interessant fur Jugendliche sind. Untersucht wird, wie die Religions- und Sinnsuche bei einem jugendlichen Publikum funktioniert und ob religiose Muster im Film sie in dieser Lebensphase uberhaupt tangieren.

Split Possession,['N/A'],"This book is a functional-typological study of possession splits in European languages. It shows that genetically and structurally diverse languages such as Icelandic, Welsh, and Maltese display possessive systems which are sensitive to semantically based distinctions reminiscent of the alienability correlation. These distinctions are grammatically relevant in many European languages because they require dedicated constructions. What makes these split possessive systems interesting for the linguist is the interaction of semantic criteria with pragmatics and syntax. Neutralisation of distinctions occurs under focus. The same happens if one of the constituents of a possessive construction is syntactically heavy. These effects can be observed in the majority of the 50 sample languages. Possessive splits are strong in those languages which are outside the Standard Average European group. The bulk of the European languages do not behave much differently from those non-European languages for which possession splits are reported. The book reveals interesting new facts about European languages and possession to typologists, universals researchers, and areal linguists.",['Language Arts & Disciplines']

Wenn seine Pflegeeltern, die Dursleys, nicht Angst hätten, er würde sie alle in Mistkäfer verwandeln, müsste er sicherlich die ganze Zeit im Besenschrank verbringen. Auf das neue Schuljahr aber freut sich Harry sehr. Doch wie sollte es anders sein - auch dieses verläuft nicht ohne Zwischenfälle. Erst verpasst er mit seinem Freund Ron den Zug nach Hogwarts, dann läuft beim ersten Quidditch-Spiel alles schief und schließlich taucht etwas unheimliches im Schloss auf, für das sogar der weise Dumbledore keine Erklärung hat.",['Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (Imaginary organization)']
Im Schattenreich der Fiktionen,['Christian Heger'],"Im Kino und in der Literatur des Phantastischen ist alles möglich: Spukhäuser halten ihre Bewohner gefangen, Wälder werden zu symbolisch verschlüsselten Traumlandschaften und verrückte Killer zwingen dem Zuschauer ihren mörderischen Blick auf. Mit grimmigem Lächeln leuchten ausgehöhlte Kürbis-Gesichter in der Dunkelheit, die für die Heldinnen und Helden manche Bewährungsprobe bereithält. Hier, im Schattenreich der Fiktionen, wird die menschliche Wahrnehmung mit gespenstischen Trugbildern konfrontiert: Fast nichts ist so, wie es scheint, doch dem, der reinen Herzens ist, helfen die Mächte des Guten durch die Finsternis.

Politics in Fantasy Media,"['Gerold Sedlmayr', 'Nicole Waller']","Fantasy is often condemned as escapist, unsophisticated and superficial. This collection of new essays puts such easy dismissals to the test by examining the ways in which Fantasy narratives present diverse, politically relevant discourses--gender, race, religion or consumerism--and thereby serve as indicators of their real-world contexts. Through their depiction of other worlds allegedly disconnected from our own, these texts are able to actualize political attitudes. Instead of categorizing Fantasy either as conservative or progressive, the essays suggest that its generic peculiarity allows the emergence of productive forms of oscillation between these extremes. Covered are J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire sequence, J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, the vampire TV series True Blood, and the dystopian computer game Fallout 3.",['Social Science']
LEGO Almanac,['Falco Ziehl'],"Wenn Investieren unterhaltsam ist, wenn Sie Spaß haben, dann verdienen Sie wahrscheinlich kein Geld. Gutes Investieren ist langweilig. George Soros So ist es beim LEGO® Investment. Sie kaufen ein Spielzeug, mit dem Sie nicht spielen dürfen. Geht es noch langweiliger? Investoren streben kontinuierlich nach neuen Möglichkeiten, um höhere finanzielle Erträge zu generieren. Seit einiger Zeit werden LEGO® Sets als aufstrebende Alternative im Bereich finanzieller Anlagen betrachtet, da sie überdurchschnittliche Renditen erzielen. Im Zeitraum von 1961 bis 2020 verzeichnete ein wertgewichteter LEGO® Set Index eine inflationsbereinigte jährliche Rendite von 8,4 Prozent. Im historischen Vergleich haben LEGO® Sets konventionellen Anlageformen wie Aktien, Rohstoffen und Sparkonten widerstanden. Die Gründe für die Wertentwicklung von LEGO® Sets sind bisher ungeklärt. Der LEGO® Almanac analysiert und bewertet eingehend die Performance von LEGO® Sets als alternative Geldanlage. Dabei wird eine umfassende datenwissenschaftliche Perspektive unter Einsatz verschiedener Datenquellen eingenommen. Die Gesamt-Performance von LEGO® Sets wird vielschichtig beurteilt, sowohl auf Set- als auch auf Themenebene, wobei zahlreiche einflussreiche weiche und harte Faktoren in die Untersuchung einfließen. Durch eine ausführliche statistische Untersuchung von 14.068 LEGO® Sets werden fundierte Schlussfolgerungen zur Performance anhand unterschiedlicher weicher und harter Faktoren gezogen. Die statistische Auswertung integriert verschiedene Methoden, um eine präzise Vorhersage der zukünftigen Entwicklung von LEGO® Sets zu ermöglichen.

Funktionen populärer Fantasy-Literatur in der christlichen Rezeption,['Hans-Christian Gebbe'],"Daily devotionals exploring spiritual themes in Harry Potter, youth pastors giving sermons wearing Jedi robes, missionary groups using Bilbo's journey to share the Gospel of Christ: There is apparently a high level of interest within the Christian community to engage with popular culture. This applies in particular to fictional works dealing with the supernatural or fantastic otherworlds. The aim of this study is to show how fantasy literature can be used in modern society to articulate religious themes. The focus lies on Christian literature such as devotional books and didactic resources for ministry addressing Christian readers in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. By analysing Christian literature reflecting Harry Potter, His Dark Materials and Left Behind (works of fantasy that strongly differ in their engagement with religious themes) this thesis shows how Christian teachers, apologists, writers and speakers create biblical analogies and use (religious) archetypes to build a bridge between the narratives of popular culture, Christian tradition and the reader’s personal story.",['Christianity and literature']

Vom Binge Watching zum Binge Thinking,"['Martin Böhnert', 'Paul Reszke']","Ob Westeros oder Hogwarts, ob Postapokalypse oder Zeitreisen – die fiktionalen Welten der Popkultur lassen ihre Rezipierenden für kurze Zeit den Alltag vergessen. Aber gerade diejenigen popkulturellen Phänomene, die nachhaltig faszinieren, gehen in ihren Weltentwürfen über die intuitive Erfassbarkeit hinaus und erlauben methodisch-reflektierte Analysen. Der Sammelband nimmt die Beziehung zwischen Popkultur und Wissenschaften als eine wechselseitige in den Blick: Es werden einerseits mit Hilfe von sprachphilosophischen oder handlungstheoretischen Ansätzen fiktive Welten – etwa vom Herrn der Ringe oder von The Walking Dead – untersucht. Andererseits illustrieren die popkulturellen Welten wie beispielsweise von Game of Thrones oder der Harry-Potter-Reihe wissenschafts- und gendertheoretische Ansätze.",['Social Science']
The cinematic child,['Christian Stewen'],"Die kulturellen Diskurse, innerhalb derer Vorstellungen von Kind und Kino miteinander verschaltet werden, sind insbesondere in den letzten Jahren allgegenwärtig, vielgestaltig und komplex vernetzt. Mithilfe des Begriffs des ""Cinematic Child"" lassen sich zentrale Deutungsebenen auffächern und miteinander in Beziehung setzen. Die Bezeichnung eröffnet den Blick auf eine spezifisch filmisch generierte Vorstellung von Kindheit. Mit Bezug auf aktuelle US-amerikanische Spielfilme der 1990er und 2000er Jahre stellen sich anhand der vier Analysekategorien Fantasie, Unschuld, Geschichte und Störung die Fragen nach medialen Konstruktionsformen und -mechanismen von Kindheit. Detaillierte Filmanalysen leiten über in die Betrachtung populärer, medienpädagogisch motivierter Diskurse, die in der Auseinandersetzung mit den filmischen Strukturen ganz ähnliche Vorstellungen von Kindheit und Medialität und ihrer wechselseitigen Beziehungen entwickeln. Innerhalb verbreiteter ""Moral Panics"" wird das zuschauende Kind als gleichsam fremd bestimmtes Opfer medialer Gewalteinwirkungen und in diesem Sinne als ein negativ geprägtes ""Cinematic Child"" sinnhaft. Der Band bietet u.a. Analysen der Filme THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA (USA/UK 2005-2008), HARRY POTTER (UK/USA 2001-2007), ROAD TO PERDITION (USA 2001), HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (USA 2001), WALK THE LINE (USA 2005), THE OTHERS (USA u.a. 2001) und THE RING (USA 2002).

The Sacred in Fantastic Fandom,"['Carole M. Cusack', 'John W.

Religion is traditional, institutional, and serious; whereas fandom is contemporary, individualistic, and fun. Can the robes of nuns and priests be compared to cosplay outfits of Jedi Knights and anime characters? Can travelling to fan conventions be understood as pilgrimages to the shrines of saints? These new essays investigate fan activities connected to books, film, and online games, such as Harry Potter-themed weddings, using The Hobbit as a sacred text, and taking on heroic roles in World of Warcraft. Young Muslim women cosplayers are brought into conversation with Chaos magicians who use pop culture tropes and characters. A range of canonical texts, such as Supernatural, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Sherlock--are examined in terms of the pleasure and enchantment of repeated viewing. Popular culture is revealed to be a fertile source of religious and spiritual creativity in the contemporary world.",['Religion']
Die Kultmarke,['Wolfram von Rhein'],"Wie Kunden zu Fans werden und eine Marke zum Kultstatus erheben Was gibt es erstrebenswerteres im Marketing, als von den Markenfans zur Kultmarke gekrönt zu werden. Zufall oder professionelle Markenführung? Vor allem Leidenschaft und maximale Sensibilität für den Markt und die ausgewählte Zielgruppe. Ein herausragend marktorientiertes Unternehmen kann viel dafür tun, dass sich die Kunden für seine Produkte begeistern und zu Markenfans werden. Dieses Buch untersucht, was Fans bewegt, welche Voraussetzungen eine Kultmarke erfüllen muss und welche Merkmale bekannte Kultmarken auszeichnen. Mithilfe konkreter Beispiele bekannter Marken zeigt Wolfram von Rhein, welche Kampagnen und Maßnahmen dazu führen können, dass sich Produkte als Kultmarken etablieren können. Aus diesen Beispielen entwickelt er instrumentelle Handlungsparameter und -tools, mit denen Unternehmen die eigene Markenentwicklung vorantreiben können. Die neun Treiber einer Kultmarke Den größten Anteil dieses Buches nehmen die maßgeblichen Attribute einer Kultmarke ein, insgesamt neun exzeptionelle Treiber, um diesen Markentyp von der etablierten Marke bzw. Megamarke zu differenzieren. Ein Eigenschaftsprofil der Kultmarke rundet die Ausführungen ab. Es ordnet die charakteristischen, einzigartigen und begeisternden Merkmale der Kultmarke hierarchisch, die in ihrer Summe dafür verantwortlich sind, dass Kunden zu den unentbehrlichen aktiven Fans der Kultmarke werden. Aus vielen herausragenden Markenbeispielen werden geeignete, wirkungsvolle, strategische und instrumentelle Handlungsparameter für die Markenführung methodisch abgeleitet, um den Nährboden für eine Kultmarke zu schaffen bzw. einen bestehenden Kultstatus zu behaupten. Mit einem Kultmarken-Canvas-Modell lassen sich die relevanten Kultmarkentreiber ganzheitlich und konsistent weiterentwickeln. Die Kultmarke findet ihren Platz in der Markentypologie Wolfram von Rhein aktualisiert und vertieft mit Hilfe empirischer Befragungen, Experteninterviews und aktueller Literatur die bisherige Diskussion über die Kultmarke, eine der schillerndsten, aber auch strittigsten Marketingbegriffe. Der Autor differenziert die Kultmarke deutlich von inflatorischen Kultbegriffen oder gar „Hype-Marken“. Bisher wurde die Kultmarke als Begriff und Definition nicht in der Markenwelt verankert, obwohl sie als die erstrebenswerte und aufmerksamkeitsstärkste Differenzierungschance gilt. In diesem Buch wird der Kultmarke aus den Erkenntnissen der Markenentwicklung ein eindeutiger Platz in der Markentypologie zugeordnet. Der Autor betont die besondere Bedeutung des Momentums für einen nicht dauerhaften Kultstatus. Er verankert deshalb auch die Kultmarke in der Markenbegriffswelt als dynamische Zwischenstufe auf dem konsequenten Weg zu einer Megamarke. Ein Unternehmen kann also viel dafür tun, dass sich die Kunden für sein Produkt begeistern und zu Markenfans werden. Eines bleibt allerdings unveränderbar: die Jury, die entscheidet, ob der Kultstatus erreicht wird, sitzt immer im externen Kreis der Kunden.",['Business & Economics']

Kulturphänomen Harry Potter,"['Ina Karg', 'Iris Mende']","English summary: The hype about J.K. Rowlings' sensationally successful series has since quieted down. From a certain distance, the many aspects of an event like the Harry Potter craze cannot be fully appreciated, but one can pursue the question how it came about that a literary work of several thousand pages was able to find a global readership although the cultural setting of this epic world is more specifically national than almost any other in world literature. A look at the public discourse, particularly around the time the last volume was released, sheds light on conceptions and expectations of literature. Above all, the texts themselves are examined, different readings are sounded out, and links are pursued to really understand the existing phenomena, literary motives, characters, traditions and narrative styles. Harry Potter surpasses all boundaries: those of language, markets, target groups, literary genres and traditions. At the same time, the multifaceted vision which the Harry Potter series necessitates signifies the need for a revision at least of conventional literary studies. German description: Inzwischen ist es um J. K. Rowlings Erfolgsserie vergleichsweise ruhig geworden. Aus einer gewissen Distanz heraus kann ein Ereignis wie Harry Potter zwar nicht in seiner ganzen Vielfalt gewurdigt werden. Jedoch kann der Frage nachgegangen werden, wie ein literarisches Werk von vielen tausend Seiten eine weltweite Leserschaft findet, wo doch der Ort des Geschehens dieser epischen Welt so kulturspezifisch-national ist wie kaum ein anderer in der gesamten Weltliteratur. Der Blick auf den offentlichen Diskurs vor allem bei Erscheinen des letzten Bandes gibt dabei Aufschluss uber die Auffassungen von und Erwartungen an Literatur. Der Blick richtet sich aber vor allem auf die Texte selbst, lotet Lesarten aus und folgt Verweislinien zu real existierenden Erscheinungen, literarischen Motiven, Figuren, Traditionen und Erzahlweisen. Harry Potter uberschreitet alle Grenzen: die der Sprache, des Marktes, der Adressatengruppe, der literarischen Genres und Traditionen. Die vielfaltige Sicht, die die Romanserie erforderlich macht, bedeutet zugleich eine Revision zumindest herkommlicher literaturwissenschaftlicher Arbeit.",['Language Arts & Disciplines']

Nicht nur an Muggel-Schulen, sondern auch in Hogwarts treiben Fieslinge ihr Unwesen. Slytherin bringt die Übelsten dieser Sorte hervor – vor allem den schrecklichen Du-weißt-schon-wen –, doch auch in den anderen Häusern sind sie zu finden. In Ravenclaw stößt man immer wieder auf den feindseligen Typus des Klugscheißers, und auch ein paar Gryffindors nutzen ihren Mumm für gemeine Zwecke. Selbst Hufflepuff bringt gelegentlich eine nicht ganz so gut gesinnte Hexe hervor, gegen die man sich verteidigen muss. In diesem Buch findest du die 101 schlagfertigsten Verwünschungen aus der magischen Harry-Potter-Welt, die sich kinderleicht in der Muggel-Welt anwenden lassen.

Harry Potter - ein moderner Mythos?,['Eva Reimann'],"Masterarbeit aus dem Jahr 2011 im Fachbereich Anglistik - Literatur, Note: 2,1, Ruhr-Universität Bochum (Englisches Seminar), Veranstaltung: Masterarbeit, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Die Harry Potter Reihe von J.K. Rowling hat zweifellos die Lesegewohnheiten von Jugendlichen rund um die Welt beeinflusst und auch viele Erwachsene haben sich von den Romanen in den Bann ziehen lassen. Es wurden spezielle Ausgaben für Erwachsene herausgegeben, die durch ein anderes Cover nicht so sehr an ein Kinderbuch erinnern. Buchläden haben bei Erscheinen der neuen Bände sogar Sonderöffnungszeiten eingerichtet, um dem Anrang der begeisterten Leserschaft Herr zu werden, Postboten haben am Erscheinungsdatum Sonderschichten in der Postzustellung auf sich nehmen müssen um sicherzustellen, dass Buchvorbestellungen bei Onlinehändlern die Leser am Erscheinungstag erreichen. Neben den Büchern ist eine große Merchandise-Maschinerie angelaufen, es gibt die Möglichkeit Poster, Tassen, Briefpapier, Taschen sowie Bettwäsche zu erwerben; insgesamt zählt man 400 verschiedene Artikel mit dem Harry Potter Konterfei.1 Zahlreiche Fanforen lassen sich im Internet finden, in denen sich die Nutzer über die Romane, aber auch die Verfilmungen, austauschen. Seit Beginn des Hype werden die Bücher auch verfilmt und sind in der geschriebenen Form in 61 Sprachen übersetzt worden, darunter exotische Sprachen wie Isländisch und Afrikaans. Inzwischen rangieren die Harry Potter Romane auf Platz drei der Allzeit-Bestsellerliste mit 250 Millionen verkauften Büchern. Stephen Brown spricht in seinem Businessweek Artikel von einem Verkaufsrang direkt nach der Bibel. Aber worauf beruht dieser Erfolg? Die Antwort ist nicht ganz einfach und beruht meiner Meinung nach auf mehreren Faktoren. Der Hauptfaktor ist, wie ich meine, vor allem die Kombination aus der realen Welt der Leser mit einer fantastischen, irrealen und unbekannten Welt voller Zauberkraft, Symbolen und Mythen, aber auch übermenschlichen Fähigkeiten. Die sieben Harry Potter Bände folgen dem Zauberlehrling Harry Potter durch seine Schulzeit auf der Zauberschule Hogwarts, einer der angesehensten Schulen in der Zauberwelt, und zeigen seinen Kampf gegen die dunkle Macht des Lord Voldemort und dessen Anhängern. Dieser hat Jahre zuvor in einem Kampf Harrys Eltern getötet und das Baby Harry mit einer Narbe für sein Leben gezeichnet. Harry Potter ist dadurch der einzige Zauberer, der einen Angriff von Lord Voldemort – ein Name den man in der Zauberwelt nicht aussprechen darf – überlebt hat.",['Literary Criticism']

Teaching in the Middle and Secondary Schools,"['Richard Dean Kellough', 'Jioanna Carjuzaa']","This practical, performance based methods text for middle and second school pre-service teachers is organized around four developmental components: Why–gives the rationale to support the components that follow What–what you will be teaching How–how you will teach it How well–how well you are teaching it. Organized into four parts that are then split up into ten modules, the text begins with a history of education going back to colonial times. The modules then cover the many and varied aspects of teaching pre and early adolescents, such as teaching students with exceptionalities, classroom management, diversity, instructional planning, using technology in the classroom, assessing student achievement, and self-assessment and continued professional development. The authors contend that the best teacher is one who has an eclectic style and can monitor their own progress and make changes and adapt their strategies if they are not succeeding. The ninth edition has been carefully updated to reflect the diversity and current topics in the field today. The book is a valuable resource for students today and as a reference for many years to come. New To This Edition: NEW! Improved balance of content between middle and secondary schools–this emphasizes that middle school is uniquely different from both high school and the traditional junior high school and that pre-and early adolescence is different from late adolescence. NEW! Technology has been integrated throughout every module of the book–New features including “Teaching Scenarios,” “Activities,” and “Technology Rich” features were added to all modules. NEW! Contributions from pre-service and in-service middle and secondary school teachers, teacher educators, and educational researchers have been added--to strengthen the tie between theory and practice.",['Education']

Untersuchung des Erfolgs der „Harry Potter“ - Bücher am Beispiel des dritten Bandes „Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban“,['Sara Hagenauer'],"Studienarbeit aus dem Jahr 2005 im Fachbereich Germanistik - Neuere Deutsche Literatur, Note: 2,0, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz (Deutsches Institut), Veranstaltung: Das phantastische Kinder- und Jugendbuch, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Die „Harry Potter“-Bücher sind ein Phänomen, von dem inzwischen so gut wie jeder gehört hat. Seit dem Erscheinen des ersten Bandes „Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen“ im Jahr 1998 haben alle Werke eine sensationelle Erfolgsgeschichte hinter sich, die kein Ende zu nehmen scheint. Dass die Bücher so große Verkaufsschlager geworden sind ist im Zuge der heutigen Gesellschaft, die sich immer weniger mit Literatur beschäftigt (erst recht wenn das Buch ca. 500 Seiten hat, wie „Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban“), verwunderlich. Ebenso überraschend ist, dass das einst als „Kinderbuch“ deklarierte Werk auch von einer beachtenswerten Anzahl von Erwachsenen gelesen wird. Somit ist eine Untersuchung der Ursache dieses Erfolgs nahe liegend. Eine große Zahl von Leuten davon überzeugt ist, dass alleine das Marketing „Harry Potter“ so berühmt gemacht hatIn meiner Arbeit gehe ich allerdings von der Hypothese aus, dass die Marketingstrategien zwar durchaus ihren Teil dazu beigetragen haben, dass „Harry Potter“ so bekannt geworden ist, die eigentliche Ursache jedoch im Werk selbst liegt. Die vorliegende Untersuchung belegt diese These am dritten Band der Reihe, „Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban“, da dieser laut einer großen Gruppe von Literaturwissenschaftlern der „wertvollste“ Band der Reihe ist.",['Literary Criticism']

J.K.

Buchläden haben bei Erscheinen der neuen Bände sogar Sonderöffnungszeiten eingerichtet um dem Andrang Herr zu werden, Postboten haben am Auslieferungstag des neuen Bandes Sonderschichten eingelegt. Aber worauf beruht dieser weltweite Erfolg? Die Antwort ist nicht ganz einfach und beruht meiner Meinung nach auf mehreren Faktoren. Der Hauptfaktor ist, wie ich meine, vor allem die Kombination aus der realen Welt der Leserschaft mit einer fantastischen, unbekannten Welt voller Zauberkraft, Symbolen und Mythen aber auch übermenschlichen Fähigkeiten. Kinder rund um die Welt wachsen mit Märchen, sowohl in schriftlich fixierter Form als auch durch rein orale Weitergabe, auf; auch hier kommen Symbole und mythische Wesen häufig vor. Unter diesem Aspekt könnte man behaupten, dass durch die Harry Potter Reihe das kindliche Erleben wieder ins Gedächtnis gerufen wird, denn die Jugendlichen sind erneut mit bekannten Symbolen und Mythen konfrontiert, so zum Beispiel Geister, Drachen, Geheimgänge oder der Kampf zwischen Gut und Böse. In den Bänden von J.K. Rowling kommen jedoch weitere Aspekte der mythischen Welt hinzu: die Bedeutung des Einhorns, Wunsch und Verlangen, der Wunsch nach ewigem Leben um nur einige Beispiele zu nennen. Es ist eben dieses Netz aus Symbolen und Mythen, die die Harry Potter Bücher auch für Erwachsene so interessant machen. Bereits David Colbert hat in der Einleitung zu seinem Buch The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter geschrieben, dass ""one of the pleasures of reading J.K.

Der Appell hinter den Harry-Potter-Büchern. Vergleich der Harry-Potter-Bücherreihe mit dem Nationalsozialismus,['N/A'],"Facharbeit (Schule) aus dem Jahr 2019 im Fachbereich Geschichte Europas - Zeitalter Weltkriege, , Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Kinder- und Jugendbücher sollen im Allgemeinen unterhaltsam und am besten auch noch lehrreich sein. Meine Kindheit wurde vor allem durch die Harry Potter Buchreihe von J. K. Rowling geprägt. Grob betrachtet, denkt man bei diesen magischen Abenteuern erst einmal an Freundschaft, fliegende Besen und böse Zauberer, doch je älter ich wurde, um so mehr fielen mir Parallelen zu den Ereignissen im Nationalsozialismus (1933-1945) unter Adolf Hitler auf. Ich beschloss, in meiner Facharbeit einen Vergleich dieser beiden Themen zu erarbeiten, um mich wissenschaftlich mit meiner These auseinanderzusetzen. Gibt es Gemeinsamkeiten? Häufen sich diese so, dass man von einer Absicht von J. K. Rowlings sprechen könnte? Folgende Vergleichspunkte werde ich in meiner Arbeit betrachten: Als erstes gebe ich einen kleinen Überblick über die Biografie Adolf Hitlers. Darauf folgt eine Darlegung der benutzten Propagandamethoden im Dritten Reich. Die Rassenlehre und die Verfolgung von als minderwertig deklarierten Rassen ist der nächste wichtige Vergleichspunkt. Zuletzt stelle ich stellvertretend einen Widerstandskämpfer, hier Graf von Stauffenberg, vor. Das Selbe vollziehe ich mit der Geschichte und den Charakteren der Harry Potter Bücher. Dabei stelle ich Voldemort als Herrscher vor. Als nächstes lege ich die von ihm praktizierte Propaganda dar. Außerdem möchte ich auch hier, auf die Rassenlehre und Verfolgung eingehen, auf welche man während des Lesens der Bücher immer wieder stößt. Als Beispiel für einen Widerstandskämpfer habe ich mich für Severus Snape entschieden. Schließlich vergleiche ich die genannten Punkte auf ihre Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede, um dann in meinem Fazit vor allem auf die oben genannten Fragen einzugehen. Bei meinem Vergleich stütze ich mich vor allem auf die Harry Potter Bücher Band eins bis sieben. Die Filme lasse ich hierbei bewusst außer Acht. Zudem ziehe ich Fachliteratur zum Leben im Nationalsozialismus hinzu.",['History']

""Er wird berühmt werden - eine Legende - [...] ganze Bücher wird man über ihn schreiben - jedes Kind auf der Welt wird seinen Namen kennen!""

Mit ihm endet eine Kinderbuchreihe, aus der bis heute weltweit 325 Millionen Exemplare in 200 Ländern verkauft wurden und die in 65 Sprachen übersetzt sind. Die Autorin dieser Bücher, Joanne K.

Joanne K. Rowlings Zauberlehrling war wochenlang in den nationalen und internationalen Bestsellerlisten vertreten, die Verfilmungen der ersten fünf Bände spielten Millionen ein und zu den Lesern gehören bekanntermaßen längst nicht nur Kinder und Jugendliche, sondern auch Erwachsene.

"Wie Harry Potter, Peter Pan und Die unendliche Geschichte auf die Leinwand gezaubert wurden",['Andreas Thomas Necknig'],"Diese Studie wurde von der Universität Koblenz-Landau als herausragende Arbeit ausgezeichnet. Harry Potter und seine Zauberwelt - zuerst im Buch, dann auf der Leinwand. «Das habe ich mir anders vorgestellt!» Eine solche Äußerung findet sich oft als Reaktion auf einen gerade gesehenen Film, der auf einem bekannten Buch beruht. Die Verfilmung entspricht meist nicht der während des Lesens gesponnenen Vorstellung. Natürlich gibt es auch den entgegengesetzten Fall. Während Romane sich der symbolischen Kraft von Sprache anvertrauen, sind die filmischen Stilmittel von vornherein komplexer, multimedialer. Wie adaptiert man literarische Stoffe für das Medium Film angemessen? Was macht eine gute Verfilmung aus? Sollte sie sich so nah wie möglich an die Romanhandlung anlehnen oder eigenen ästhetischen Regeln genügen? Gerade die phantastische Kinder- und Jugendliteratur stellt den Filmemacher diesbezüglich vor eine Reihe von schwierigen Aufgaben. Eine besondere Herausforderung ist es, zugleich eine kindgerechte Präsentation des Stoffes zu gewährleisten und das ästhetische Potential eben dieses Stoffes in Bild und Ton angemessen umzusetzen. Am Beispiel der Filmadaptionen von Harry Potter, Peter Pan und Die Unendliche Geschichte werden diese Fragen filmanalytisch untersucht.",['Education']

The Lord of the Rings and Philosophy,"['Gregory Bassham', 'Eric Bronson']","The Lord of the Rings is intended to be applicable to the real world of relationships, religion, pleasure, pain, and politics. Tolkien himself said that his grand tale of wizards, orcs, hobbits, and elves was aimed at truth and good morals in the actual world. Analysis of the popular appeal of The Lord of the Rings (on websites and elsewhere) shows that Tolkien fans are hungry for discussion of the urgent moral and cosmological issues arising out of this fantastic epic story. Can political power be wielded for good, or must it always corrupt? Does technology destroy the truly human? Is it morally wrong to give up hope? Can we find meaning in chance events? In The Lord of the Rings and Philosophy, seventeen young philosophy professors, all of them ardent Tolkien fans and most of them contributors to the four earlier volumes in the Popular Culture and Philosophy series, address some of these important issues and show how clues to their solutions may be found in the imaginary world of Middle-earth. The book is divided into five sections, concerned with Power and the Ring, the Quest for Happiness, Good and Evil in Middle-earth, Time and Mortality, and the Relevance",['Philosophy']

After examining Tolkien's fiction in order better to appreciate Christian influences, this volume takes a closer look at Tolkien's theology of fantasy, his response to the more skeptical origins of religion research, and applies his work to contemporary questions about method in biblical studies.

Hollywood Online,['Ian London'],"Hollywood Online provides a historical account of motion picture websites from 1993 to 2008 and their marketing function as industrial advertisements for video and other media in the digital age. The Blair Witch Project is the most important example of online film promotion in cinema history. Over the last thirty years only a small number of major and independent distributors have converted internet-created buzz into box-office revenues with similar levels of success. Yet readings of how the film's internet campaign broke new ground in the summer of 1999 tend to minimize, overlook or ignore the significance of other online film promotions. Similarly, claims that Blair initiated a cycle of imitators have been repeated in film publications and academic studies for more than two decades. This book challenges three major narratives in studies about online film marketing: Hollywood's major studios and independents had no significant relationship to the internet in the 1990s; online film promotions only took off after 1999 because of Blair; and Hollywood cashed-in by initiating a cycle of imitators and scaling up corporate activities online. Hollywood Online tests these assumptions by exploring internet marketing up to and including the film's success online (Pre-Blair, 1993-9), then by examining the period immediately after Blair (Post-Blair, 2000-8) which broadly coincides with the rise and decline of DVD, as well as the emergence of the social media sites MySpace, Facebook and Twitter.",['Performing Arts']
The Lord of the Rings Official Movie Guide,['Brian Sibley'],"The mythos, landscapes and characters that Tolkien created are nothing short of spectacular, and it has taken four decades for cinema technology to reach the necessary level of sophistication to bring them to life. Now, Peter Jackson has accomplished the extraordinary feat of making three motion pictures simultaneously to capture Tolkien's vision in its entirety. For the past several years, Peter Jackson and his team of dedicated filmmakers have been working day and night to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece of epic adventure, The Lord of the Rings, to the screen. They have filmed all over the landscapes of New Zealand, and drawn on the skills of a small army of artists -- including digital wizards, medieval weapons experts, stone sculptors, linguists, costumers, makeup designers, blacksmiths and model builders -- together with a cast of internationally renowned actors and literally thousands of extras, to make this ambitious dream come true. And the boundaries of special effects have been pushed to, and beyond, their limits to make The Lord of the Rings Trilogy a ground-breaking and visually stunning cinematic experience. Designed as a celebration of the films, The Lord of the Rings Official Movie Guide is a lavishly illustrated behind-the-scenes guide which includes full-color photos of the cast, locations, sets, monsters and costumes, together with exclusive interviews with Peter Jackson and all the principal cast.

Translation and Localisation in Video Games,['Miguel Á. Bernal-Merino'],"This book is a multidisciplinary study of the translation and localisation of video games. It offers a descriptive analysis of the industry – understood as a global phenomenon in entertainment – and aims to explain the norms governing present industry practices, as well as game localisation processes. Additionally, it discusses particular translation issues that are unique to the multichannel nature of video games, in which verbal and nonverbal signs must be cohesively combined with interactivity to achieve maximum playability and immerse players in the game’s virtual world. Although positioned within the theoretical framework of descriptive translation studies, Bernal-Merino incorporates research from audiovisual translation, software localisation, computer assisted translation, comparative literature, and video game production. Moving beyond this framework, Translation and Localisation in Video Games challenges some of the basic tenets of translation studies and proposes changes to established and unsatisfactory processes in the video game and language services industries.",['Games & Activities']

Oasis of Imagination,['Ted Turnau'],"What should creative Christian cultural engagement look like?

There is another way: using our imaginations to plant 'oases' in the desert, breathable spaces that refresh, challenge, and draw together Christians and non-Christians alike. Oases refresh the soul, provoke discussion, challenge assumptions and lead the imagination to a new place. In Oasis of Imagination, Ted Turnau lays out the Biblical mandate for engaging culture, and why the imaginative path holds promise. He explores the nature of the imagination from both Scripture and nature. He asks, ""What does a Christian imagination that resonates with non-Christians look like?"" He explores examples of Christian creativity done well from video games to movies to music to The Lord of the Rings. He challenges the church, artist and non-artist alike, to be intentional about their own imaginative lives, how we can support each other, as together we engage in building bridges and being cultural ambassadors to the wider community. In-depth and wide-ranging, Oasis of Imagination equips and encourages Christians, whatever their calling, to consider how to imaginatively enter into the broader cultural conversation.",['Art']

Grounded in close analytical, critical, and theoretical work identifying the key traits of music and sound in this “peak TV” period, the book casts its critical net wider to develop interpretations of significance not just for screen music studies and musicology, but for screen and media studies too. By theorizing “peakness” with respect to sound and music, and by drawing together contributions from a diverse collection of prominent musicologists, media scholars, and practitioners, this handbook provides the authoritative guide to the role music has played in creating the success of some of the most culturally and commercially significant popular art of the early twenty-first century. The volume contains 25 essays in three main sections—Concepts and Aesthetics, Practices and Production, and Audiences and Interpretations. Topics discussed include peakness, complexity, ostentatious scoring, antiheroes, memory, franchises, worldbuilding, nostalgia, maternity, trauma, actor’s voices, title sequences, library music, branding, queer/camp scoring, kids TV, captioning, industry practices, HBO, and sound design.

His engaging prose is marked by a blend of scholarly rigor and accessible narrative, inviting readers to explore the interplay of jewelry and identity within various historical contexts. Kunz's extensive research is evident, as he includes illustrations and examples from his own collection, enriching the reader's understanding of the artistry involved in ring-making. Kunz, a prominent gemologist and lapidary, had a profound passion for gemstones and their aesthetic and symbolic values, which undoubtedly informed his writing. His expertise is drawn from a lifetime dedicated to studying precious stones, where he became one of the foremost authorities in his field. This passion is evident in the way he intricately weaves personal anecdotes and historical anecdotes, bridging the gap between nature's beauty and human creativity. ""Rings for the Finger"" is a must-read for jewelry enthusiasts, historians, and anyone with an appreciation for the nuanced narratives encoded in adornments.

Davis wants people to think about what this life really means and what are we really supposed to be doing. She talks about life's toughest and deepest questions but does it in a light-hearted way.

""Because God is supernatural-when you get closer to Him you can't help but experience the supernatural and that is what happened to us.""

Beginning with Tolkien's earliest influence—and drawing on key moments from his life, Tolkien in the Twenty-First Century is an engaging and vibrant reinterpretation of the beloved author's work. Not only does it trace the genesis and inspiration for the original books, but the narrative also explores the later film and literary adaptations that have cemented his reputation as a cultural phenomenon. Delving deep into topics such as friendship, failure, the environment, diversity, and Tolkien's place in a post-Covid age, Nick Groom takes us on an unexpected journey through Tolkien's world, revealing how it is more relevant now than perhaps Tolkien himself ever envisioned.",['Literary Criticism']

Many Are Called but Few Are Ready,['Jeremiah Merritt'],"How do you know if you know Jesus? Because you attend church? Because you operate in spiritual gifts? Because your life has changed for the better? Those may seem like cynical questions until we take a closer look at the scriptures. Matthew, the seventh chapter, makes it clear that many churchgoing men and woman, who operate in spiritual gifts, will be rejected by Jesus because they dont know him. They had cast out devils or operated in deliverance ministry, healed the sick, and done many great works, yet they knew not the one in whose name they were doing it in. It is possible to answer the call without knowing the One who called you. In this insightful and groundbreaking book, respected author, prophet, and teacher Jeremiah Merritt shares with you: *How to discern and recognize the biblical Jesus *How to practically apply being a son of God, in the earth *The role of sanctification in our relationship with Jesus Christ *The satanic role of false prophets and teachers in keeping unsuspecting men and woman in the church from knowing who Jesus really is *Understand the difference between God preserving us from wrath, or reserving us for wrath. You will walk away from your experience with this book being able to biblically and accurately discern your relationship with Jesus Christ, and have a divine, spiritual confidence to know where you stand with him.",['Religion']

Christ is My Beloved,['George E Stevens'],"The study of Christ in the Scriptures is heart-warming and encouraging at any time. The author's portraits of Christ in the Song of Solomon breathe life and reverence into the interpretation of a book that is so often misunderstood. For the most part, he uses Scripture to interpret Scripture - an exemplary method of Bible study. Where this is not possible, he has used the characteristics of natural life to bring about understanding. The Lord Jesus Christ is honoured on almost every page. Furthermore, he reveals the appreciation of love between the Messiah and Zion (along with that for the Church); and that Jerusalem can look forward to a bright future, after a period of severe persecution. This is a book that stirs up affection for the Son of the living God, leading the reader to worship the Father whose counsels and purposes are centred, as always, in Christ.",['Religion']

The Power of the God Who Can’t,['Russ Dean'],"In a world that values power above all else, we need to rethink God. It's not just better athletes and bigger engines, but weapons of mass destruction, assault rifles, lethal drugs. Our obsession with stronger, faster, more and bigger everything is killing us--and at the top of this power pyramid an all-powerful God validates it all. For those who want a theology justifying the power game in all its forms, omnipotence is the perfect pretext, but for a growing segment of our modern, scientific world, the notion of an all-controlling deity sounds increasingly superstitious, tribalistic. People of faith must do better. Our world needs a God whose nature is love, not all-controlling power. That God, the God who can't, is even more powerful. The survival of the world--even the future of God--may depend on us learning to say, ""God always does everything God can do.""",['Religion']

Stories from the Sidelines,['Malinda Fugate'],"The pages of the Bible are full of ordinary people placed in extraordinary circumstances that we often overlook or forget. Stories From the Sidelines offers a refreshing exploration of biblical narratives focusing on characters who played supporting roles rather than the heroes we know and love. Through imaginative retellings, this book explores the lives of various Old and New Testament characters, such as Noah’s sons, Job’s wife, Apollos, and the women of the early church. Each story is followed by an application, highlighting the relevance of these ancient accounts in today’s world. Readers will encounter characters who may be new to them, like Huldah or the sons of Hassenaah. What was it like to be the younger brother of Joseph or the oldest brother of King David? Two scouts went ahead of Israel into the Promised Land. Joshua became their leader, but the other scout’s faithfulness to God is worth remembering. Stories From the Sidelines challenges readers to appreciate the depth and complexity of biblical figures often relegated to the margins. It provides insights into human nature and moral choices, encouraging readers to reflect on their own lives and the often-unsung influences around them and is a compelling invitation to rediscover the richness of biblical stories through the eyes of those who stood on the sidelines but whose lives still offer valuable lessons today.",['Religion']

Studying the Event Film,['Harriet Margolis'],"In an increasingly global market, the Hollywood film industry is evolving rapidly. Once a stand-alone entity, the Hollywood blockbuster is now integrated more closely than ever with the internet, computer games and news media. This growing synergy has given rise to a new phenomenon: the event film. As a work that transcends the boundaries and expectations of conventional film, Peter Jackson’s epic trilogy The Lord of the Rings makes a perfect case study for this emerging phenomenon. In a carefully-structured collection of essays, the authors cover every aspect of the event film from its inception through to marketing of the finished product. The financial implications of planning and producing an event film are examined, with clear analyses of tax breaks and marketing strategies. Consideration is also given to the philosophical and social impact of event films, including effects on national identity and tourism in an age of globalization. The twenty-five contributors to this volume come from an eclectic range of backgrounds, but share a perspective grounded in Aotearoa, New Zealand, the land of Middle-earth. Their expertise in fields as diverse as business, communications, geography, music, film and media studies combines to provide a clear understanding of how ‘creative industries’ will figure in future economics. Studying the event film offers a unique entry point for studying twenty-first century media, and is essential reading for fans of The Lord of the Rings and for anyone interested in contemporary Hollywood as a global industrial and cultural phenomenon.",['Performing Arts']

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA – Complete Collection,['C. S. Lewis'],"The Chronicles of Narnia – Complete Collection is a seminal work of children's literature that masterfully intertwines fantasy with profound moral and theological themes. Comprising seven intricately woven tales, Lewis's narrative transports readers to a magical world where talking animals and mythical creatures confront the dualities of good and evil. Characterized by rich descriptions and allegorical depth, the prose exhibits a blend of imagination and moral inquiry, inviting readers to explore complex themes such as sacrifice, redemption, and the nature of faith within a seemingly whimsical narrative framework. C. S. Lewis, a distinguished scholar and member of the Inklings literary group, was profoundly influenced by his own spiritual journey from atheism to Christianity. This transformation significantly informs Narnia's allegorical layers, as Lewis sought to convey spiritual truths through a fantastical lens. His background in literature and philosophy, coupled with an innate passion for storytelling, enabled him to create a timeless series that resonates across generations and cultures, providing an accessible yet profound exploration of fundamental human questions. Readers are warmly invited to immerse themselves in The Chronicles of Narnia – Complete Collection, a series that not only entertains but also challenges the imagination and moral compass.

In the Highest Degree: Volume Two,['P. H. Brazier'],"The theological and philosophical works of C. S. Lewis were grounded in the argument from reason (being a form of revelation that predates nature and relates to the divine; i.e., the Word of God, Christ the Logos). These essays provide some understanding of the essentials to Lewis's philosophical theology--that is, the essentia, ""in the highest degree."" Lewis's corpus can seem disparate, but here we find unity in his aims, objectives, and methodology, a consistency that demonstrates the deep roots of his philosophical theology in Scripture, Greek philosophy, patristic and medieval theology, and some of the Reformers, all framed by a reasoned discipline from a perceptive and critical mind: method and form, content and reason, for the glory of God. From an analysis of reason to the evidence of Christ as the light of the world across human endeavors and religions, a doctrine of election, and an understanding of Scripture (""the Philosophy of the Incarnation,"" as Lewis termed it), in fundamental arguments with various modern/liberal theologians, we find evidence for the actuality of the incarnation: the divinity of Christ.",['Religion']

Removing the Dragon Skin,['Jeremiah C. Braudrick'],"For anyone who has ever longed for God but always felt like his love was just out of reach; for anyone whose messy story has made them feel like a third-string player on God’s team; for anyone whose soul feels beaten, battered, and in desperate need of some healing, C. S. Lewis just may have a remedy. This collection of essays and memoirs, delivered by an author whose fundamentalist upbringing painted a picture of a God who was simply impossible to please, are written for anyone whose has struggled with their spiritual self-worth. After life threw him a few curveballs, he was convinced that the God whose approval he yearned for, simply had no use for him. Lewis helped to changed that. This story about falling back in love with God takes the reader on a three-year journey in which the author digested just about every word Lewis ever wrote, including many of his classics, his lesser-known writings, and even personal letters he wrote to family, friends, fans, and even children. The memoirs will journey to Lewis’s home and favorite pub in Oxford, his office in Cambridge, his church, his gravesite, and more.",['Biography & Autobiography']
Persona and Paradox,['Suzanne Bray'],"Although certain aspects of C.S. Lewis’s work have been studied in great detail, others have been comparatively neglected. This collection of essays looks at Lewis’s life and work, and those of his friends and associates, from many different angles, but all connected through a common theme of identity. Questions of identity are essential to the understanding of any writer. The ways authors perceive themselves and who they are, the communities they belong to by birth or choice, inevitably influence their work. The way they present other people, real or fictional, are also rooted in their own conception of identity. In this volume, scholars from several countries examine gender and family roles; national, regional, racial and professional identities; membership of a particular church; ideological attachments and personal descriptions, either with regard to Lewis and those who knew him and influenced him, or in a study of their writings. Authors studied here include J.R.R. Tolkien, Dorothy L. Sayers, Charles Williams, George MacDonald and T.S. Eliot.",['Literary Criticism']

Evil in the Christian Fantasy of C.S. Lewis and J.K. Rowling,['Sarah Fiona Winters'],"Evil in the Christian Fantasy of C.S. Lewis and J.K. Rowling: From the White Witch to the Dark Mark argues that The Chronicles of Narnia and Harry Potter series are essential reading for anyone committed to understanding the cultural constructions of evil in twentieth-century Europe, and the strategies of resistance available to different types of readers in response to those evils. This book also suggests that while the construction of evil in both series can and should be approached through a secular lens, it cannot be fully understood without a complementary understanding of religious transcendence. Sarah Fiona Winters explores the tension between theological evil on the one hand, and naturalist and politico-historical representations of evil on the other; and the tension within both the explicitly religious and the apparently secular between dualism, the belief that good and evil both exist and are locked in combat, and the belief in orthodox Christianity that evil is nothing. She examines the developments in theories about evil that arose from the experience of the Second World War, particularly those of Hannah Arendt and Stanley Milgram in 1963, arguing that Lewis presented obedience as a strategy against evil because he wrote before their work while Rowling presents disobedience as a strategy against evil as she wrote after their work.",['Literary Criticism']

C. S. Lewis,['Bruce L. Edwards'],"Most popularly known as the author of the children's classic The Chronicles of Narnia, C. S. Lewis was also a prolific poet, essayist, novelist, and Christian writer. His most famous work, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, while known as a children's book is often read as a Christian allegory and remains to this day one of his best-loved works. But Lewis was prolific in a number of areas, including poetry, Christian writing, literary criticism, letters, memoir, autobiography, sermons and more. This set, written by experts, guides readers to a better understanding and appreciation of this important and influential writer. Clive Staples Lewis was born on November 29, 1898, in Belfast, Northern Ireland. His mother died when he was young, leaving his father to raise him and his older brother Warren. He fought and was wounded in World War I and later became immersed in the spiritual life of Christianity. While he delved into the world of Christian writing, he did not limit himself to one genre and produced a remarkable oeuvre that continues to be widely read, taught, and adored at all levels. As part of the circle known as the Inklings, which consisted of writers and intellectuals, and included J.R.R. Tolkien, Charles Williams, and others, he developed and honed his skills and continued to put out extensive writings. Many different groups now claim him as their own: spanning genres from science fiction to Christian literature, from nonfiction to children's stories, his output remains among the most popular and complex. Here, experts in the field of Lewis studies examine all his works along with the details of his life and the culture in which he lived to give readers the fullest complete picture of the man, the writer, and the husband, alongside his works, his legacy, and his place in English letters.",['Literary Criticism']

C. S.

The Inklings that are examined in this anthology are C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Owen Barfield, with two of their literary predecessors and influences that are included under the term “Inklings” in this anthology: G. K. Chesterton and George MacDonald. Readers will find new territory for further exploration of C. S. Lewis and the Inklings in the areas of 1) creative collaboration among the Inklings; 2) genres (for example, the penny dreadful, Christian liturgical poetry); 3) literary influences (H. G. Wells, Dante); 4) linguistics (Tolkien’s “web of words”); and 5) the convergence of literature and theology. Other areas, which readers would find interesting, are medieval cosmology, classical mythology and Nordic mythology in Lewis’s and Tolkien’s works (the pagan mythology of the Greeks and Romans, and the Nordic myth of Ragnarök). Consequently, Lewis’s A Discarded Image was studied by several contributors to substantiate his knowledge on the medieval cosmos.",['Literary Criticism']

The Danger of Romance,['Karen Sullivan'],"The curious paradox of romance is that, throughout its history, this genre has been dismissed as trivial and unintellectual, yet people have never ceased to flock to it with enthusiasm and even fervor. In contemporary contexts, we devour popular romance and fantasy novels like The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones, reference them in conversations, and create online communities to expound, passionately and intelligently, upon their characters and worlds. But romance is “unrealistic,” critics say, doing readers a disservice by not accurately representing human experiences. It is considered by some to be a distraction from real literature, a distraction from real life, and little more. Yet is it possible that romance is expressing a truth—and a truth unrecognized by realist genres? The Arthurian literature of the Middle Ages, Karen Sullivan argues, consistently ventriloquizes in its pages the criticisms that were being made of romance at the time, and implicitly defends itself against those criticisms. The Danger of Romance shows that the conviction that ordinary reality is the only reality is itself an assumption, and one that can blind those who hold it to the extraordinary phenomena that exist around them. It demonstrates that that which is rare, ephemeral, and inexplicable is no less real than that which is commonplace, long-lasting, and easily accounted for. If romance continues to appeal to audiences today, whether in its Arthurian prototype or in its more recent incarnations, it is because it confirms the perception—or even the hope—of a beauty and truth in the world that realist genres deny.",['History']
A Narnian Vision of the Atonement,['Charles Taliaferro'],"How can we have redemption or atonement (at-one-ment) with God? Ancient Christians proposed a ransom theory, according to which God pays the ransom for us through heroic self-sacrifice so we can be liberated from the power of the demonic, sin, and death. This theory is widely rejected by philosophers and theologians, yet C. S. Lewis boldly portrays atonement in precisely such terms in his seven-volume The Chronicles of Narnia. In this book, philosopher Charles Taliaferro defends the integrity and beauty of redemption in these stories and offers a Narnia-inspired Christian theory of atonement. He writes for those intrigued by Lewis's imaginary world of Narnia and for those interested in thinking about temptation, how wrongdoing may be overcome, confession, repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation, restitution, death, resurrection, and personal transformation. Taliaferro argues that Lewis's work is no mere entertaining fairytale for children but an important lens through which to view deep themes of redemption and atonement, and all the vital stages involved in overcoming evil with the superabundant good of God's loving self-sacrifice.",['Religion']

The Fame of C. S. Lewis,['Stephanie L. Derrick'],"C. S. Lewis, long renowned for his children's books as well as his Christian apologetics, has been the subject of wide interest since he first stepped-up to the BBC's microphone during the Second World War. Until now, however, the reasons why this medievalist began writing books for a popular audience, and why these books have continued to be so popular, had not been fully explored. In fact Lewis, who once described himself as by nature an 'extreme anarchist', was a critical controversialist in his time-and not to everyone's liking. Yet, somehow, Lewis's books directed at children and middlebrow Christians have continued to resonate in the decades since his death in 1963. Stephanie L. Derrick considers why this is the case, and why it is more true in America than in Lewis's home-country of Britain. The story of C. S. Lewis's fame is one that takes us from his childhood in Edwardian Belfast, to the height of international conflict during the 1940s, to the rapid expansion of the paperback market, and on to readers' experiences in the 1980s and 1990s, and, finally, to London in November 2013, where Lewis was honoured with a stone in Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey. Derrick shows that, in fact, the author himself was only one actor among many shaping a multi-faceted image. The Fame of C. S. Lewis is the most comprehensive account of Lewis's popularity to date, drawing on a wealth of fresh material and with much to interest scholars and C. S. Lewis admirers alike.",['Biography & Autobiography']
Media and Translation,['Dror Abend-David'],"Over the last decade there has been a dramatic increase in publications on media and translation. In fact, there are those who believe that so much has been published in this field that any further publications are superfluous. But if one views media and translation as anything ranging from film and television drama to news-casting, commercials, video games, web-pages and electronic street signs, it would seem that research in media and translation has barely scratched the surface. The research in this field is shared largely by scholars in communication and translation studies, often without knowledge of each other or access to their respective methods of scholarship. This collection will rectify this lack of communication by bringing such scholars together and creating a context for a theoretical discussion of the entire emerging field of Media and Translation, with a preference for theoretical work (rather than case studies) on translation and communications of various forms, and through various media.",['Social Science']

C. S. Lewis and the Christian Worldview,['Michael L. Peterson'],"C. S. Lewis is one of the most influential and beloved Christian writers of the past century, and interest in him continues to grow as books about his fantasy, fiction, and biography continue to appear. Although Lewis's personal journey was a deeply philosophical search for the most adequate worldview, the few extant books about his Christian philosophy focus on specific topics rather than his overall worldview. In this book, Michael Peterson develops a comprehensive framework for understanding Lewis's Christian worldview--from his arguments from reason, morality, and desire to his ideas about Incarnation, Trinity, and Atonement. All worldviews address fundamental questions about reality, knowledge, human nature, meaning, and so forth. Peterson therefore examines Lewis's Christian approach to these same questions in interaction with other worldviews. Accenting that the intellectual strength and existential relevance of Lewis's works rest on his philosophical acumen as well as his Christian orthodoxy--which he famously called ""mere Christianity""--Peterson skillfully shows how Lewis's Christian thought engages a variety of important problems raised by believers and nonbelievers alike: the problem of evil and suffering, the problem of religious diversity, the problem of meaning, and others. Just as Lewis was gifted in communicating philosophical ideas and arguments in an accessible style, Peterson has crafted a major contribution to Lewis scholarship presented in a way that will interest scholars and benefit the general reader.",['Religion']

"C.S. Lewis--On the Christ of a Religious Economy, 3.1",['P. H. Brazier'],"C. S. Lewis--On the Christ of a Religious Economy I, Creation and Sub-Creation opens with Lewis on creation, the fall into original sin, and the human condition before God and how such an understanding permeated all his work, post-conversion. For Lewis, Christ, the second person of the Trinity, is the agent of creation and its redeemer. This leads into Lewis's representation through sub-creation: explaining salvation history and the purpose of the creation and the creature through story (The Chronicles of Narnia, The Space Trilogy, Screwtape, etc.), but also the question of multiple incarnations, and the encounters he pens between Aslan-Christ and creatures. What does this tell us about the human predicament and our state after the fall? This volume forms the first part of the third book in a series of studies on the theology of C. S. Lewis titled C. S. Lewis: Revelation and the Christ. The books are written for academics and students, but also, crucially, for those people, ordinary Christians, without a theology degree who enjoy and gain sustenance from reading Lewis's work.",['Religion']
The chronicles of Narnia: Pertempuran terakhir,['Clive Staples Lewis'],"Journeys to the end of the world, fantastic creatures, and epic battles between good and evil -- what more could any reader ask for in one book? The book that has it all is The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, written in 1949 by Clive Staples Lewis. But Lewis did not stop there. Six more books followed, and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia. For the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a land where magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations.",['Children']
Into the Wardrobe,['David C. Downing'],"Published in the early 1950s, C. S. Lewis's seven Chronicles of Narnia were proclaimed instant children's classics and have been hailed in The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature as ""the most sustained achievement in fantasy for children by a 20th-century author."" But how could Lewis (a formidable critic, scholar, and Christian apologist)conjure up the kind of adventures in which generations of children (and adults) take such delight? In this engaging and insightful book, C. S. Lewis expert David C. Downing invites readers to join his vivid exploration of the Chronicles of Narnia, offering a detailed look at the enchanting stories themselves and also focusing on the extraordinary intellect and imagination of the man behind the Wardrobe. Downing presents each Narnia book as its own little wardrobe - each tale an opportunity to discover a visionary world of bustling vitality, sparkling beauty, and spiritual clarity. And Downing's examination of C. S. Lewis's personal life shows how the content of these classic children's books reflects Lewis's love of wonder and story, his affection for animals and homespun things, his shrewd observations about human nature, along with his vast reading, robust humor, theological speculations, medieval scholarship, and arcane linguistic jokes. A fun glossary of odd and invented words will allow readers to speak with Narnian flair, regaling friends and family with unusual words like cantrips, poltoonery, hastilude, and skirling. A masterful work that will appeal to both new and seasoned fans of Narnia, Into the Wardrobe offers a journey beyond Narnia's deceptively simple surface and into its richly textured and unexpected depths.",['Social Science']

"Popular Experience and Cultural Representation of the Great War, 1914-1918","['Ruth Larsen', 'Ian Whitehead']","This book considers the diversity of the experiences and legacies of the First World War, looking at the actions of those who fought, those who remained at home and those who returned from the arena of war. It examines Edwardian ideals of gender and how these shaped social expectations of the roles to be played by men and women with regards to the national cause. It looks at men’s experiences of combat and killing on the Western Front, exploring the ways in which masculine gender ideals and male social relationships moulded their experience of battle. It shows how the women of the controversial White Feather campaign exploited traditional ideas of heroism and male duty in war to embarrass men into volunteering for military service. The book also examines children’s toys and recreation, underlining how play helped to promote patriotic values in children and thus prepared boys and girls for the respective roles they might be called upon to make in war. A strong sense of British identity and a faith in the superiority of British values, customs and institutions underpinned the collective war effort. The book looks at how, even in captivity at the Ruhleben internment camp, the British gave expression to this identity. The book emphasises the extent to which this was a conflict in which Britain sought to defend and even extend its imperial dominion. It also discusses how different political and cultural agendas have shaped the way in which Britain has remembered the War. As such, the book reflects the diversity of popular experience in the War, both at home and in the empire. Britain’s entry into the War in 1914 helped to ensure that it became a truly global conflict. The contributors here draw attention to the significant social, cultural and political legacies for Britain and her empire of a conflict which, one hundred years later, continues to be the subject of considerable controversy.",['History']
The Ultimate Lost and Philosophy,['Sharon Kaye'],"Health Economics and Financing What are the metaphysics of time travel? How can Hurley exist in two places at the same time?

So there’s, like, this island? And a bunch of us were on Oceanic flight 815 and we crashed on it. I kinda thought it was my fault, because of those numbers. I thought they were bad luck. We’ve seen the craziest things here, like a polar bear and a Smoke Monster, and we traveled through time back to the 1970s. And we met the Dharma dudes. Arzt even blew himself up. For a long time, I thought I was crazy. But now, I think it might have been destiny. The island’s made me question a lot of things. Like, why is it that Locke and Desmond have the same names as real philosophers? Why do so many of us have trouble with our dads? Did Jack have a choice in becoming our leader? And what’s up with Vincent? I mean, he’s gotta be more than just a dog, right? I dunno. We’ve all felt pretty lost. I just hope we can trust Jacob, otherwise ... whoa.

Reasoning beyond Reason,['Jeff Sellars'],"There is a seeming dichotomy in C. S. Lewis's writing. On the one hand we see the writer of argumentative works, and on the other hand we have the imaginative poet. Lewis also found this dichotomy within himself. When he was a rationalist and atheist he found that these two sides of him were pulling in different directions: he believed that his rationalist side could not be reconciled with his imaginative side. Once he became a Christian, he eventually found a means of marrying the two--principally, through story and myth.Within C. S. Lewis studies, there is also a common conception of Lewis as a modern rationalist philosopher, i.e., a rationalist who thinks arguments (and his arguments in particular) are the last answer on the questions he undertakes. Reasoning beyond Reason attempts to take this view to task by placing Lewis back into his pre-modern context and showing that his sources and influences are classical ones. In this process Lewis is viewed through the idea that imagination and reason are connected in an intimate way: they are different expressions of a single divine source of truth, and there is an imagination already present upon which reason works. Lewis's ""transpositional"" view of imagination implicitly pushes towards a somewhat radical position: the imagination is to be seen as theological in its reliance upon something more than the merely material; it necessarily relies on a transcendent funding for its use and meaning. In other words, the imagination is a well-source for what we might normally label ""rational.""",['Religion']

Subcreation: Fictional-World Construction from J.R.R. Tolkien to Terry Pratchett and Tad Williams,['Stefanie Schult'],"The doctorial thesis argues that the term Subcreation with its revised and broadened definition, in part differing from J.R.R. Tolkien's original term sub-creation, may be used for the discussion of the making of fictional worlds in literary discourse. The successful conception of a fictional world depends on the reader's willing suspension of disbelief. This depends both on the author and his skilled composition of the world and all its aspects, as well as on the reader's acceptance of this invented fictional world. The author needs to create a narrative with an inner consistency, which is crucial to achieving the effect of the reader's immersion in the fictional world. The fundamental aspects that an author needs to realize to achieve successful Subcreation have been structured into and analysed in four categories: Language and Linguistic Variation, Physiopoeia, Anthropoeia and Mythopoeia. Furthermore, this thesis shows that, as contemporary examples of fantastic literature, both Tad Williams's and Terry Pratchett's fictional worlds are successfully created through the realization of these aspects of Subcreation. Apart from commenting on the success of the subcreative process, this thesis also remarks upon the cultural influences both authors include in their writings. While both may be considered Anglophone in a general categorization, Pratchett's Discworld retains a feeling of 'Britishness' that is not to be found in Williams's Otherland. The thesis proposes several approaches to Subcreation that may be studied subsequently. So, for example, it may be possible to determine the success of an author's Subcreation by collecting empirical data. Apart from literary works this field of studies may also include other media.",['Language Arts & Disciplines']

On Earth as in Heaven,['David Clark'],"Convinced that we can no longer have direct, unmediated access to the sense of Jesuss prayer but must account for the history of its effects, David Clark seeks to trace the meaning of one of Christianitys most repeated, and thus most effective texts through the early centuries of the faith. Clark begins by arguing that the prayers original context was in a revival of Jewish prayer, then sets it in the literary context of Gospels that, he argues, represented Jesus as recapitulating Israels testing in the wilderness in his own temptation. He then traces the prayers meaning within the narratives of Matthew and Luke and in the Didache, then examines the first full commentary on the prayer, that of Tertullian in the third century CE. Clark attends to the evolution of ideas and themes embodied in the prayer and of the understanding of prayer itself across epic transitions, from Judaism to the teaching of Jesus, from Jesus to the Gospels, and from the Gospels to earliest self- consciously catholic Christianity. This is an engaging narrative of the history behind and reception of the Lords Prayer; it illustrates how a texts reception may help us explore and understand the multivalent meaning of the text itself.",['Religion']

Towards the Day after Tomorrow,['P. H. Brazier'],"Humanity is moving ever towards its final destination without knowing why, when, where: teloi, multiple paths, leading towards God’s eschaton. These essays examine the movement towards this day of reckoning, and how such eschatological events are projected back into time. Towards the Day after Tomorrow, or the one after that, or months, decades—centuries—away, often we behave as though the end is upon us. These essays start with the beginning of the end: the incarnation. We examine the origins of Karl Barth’s realized eschatology in Expressionism. We consider death and judgment, as usurped by humanity, an eschaton without God’s forgiving judgment: multiple Holocausts. War ushers in the eschaton, but how do Christians handle conflict in the light of a redefined just war theory? We analyze the eschatological insights into humanity’s end in The Simpsons—post mortem. Consider the issue of atheistic human authorities usurping God’s judgment. Finally crisis and judgment are glimpsed in the mindset of people who suffer seizures—postlapsarian exile, the sufferance of salvation: how God blesses us despite the chaos of our human-generated teloi, in preparation for the end. As the end approaches, events become darker, chaotic, confusion reigns: “Judas immediately went out. And it was night.”",['Religion']

"Innocence, Heterosexuality, and the Queerness of Children's Literature",['Tison Pugh'],"Innocence, Heterosexuality, and the Queerness of Children’s Literature examines distinguished classics of children’s literature both old and new—including L. Frank Baum’s Oz books, Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House series, J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter novels, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events, and Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight series—to explore the queer tensions between innocence and heterosexuality within their pages. Pugh argues that children cannot retain their innocence of sexuality while learning about normative heterosexuality, yet this inherent paradox runs throughout many classic narratives of literature for young readers. Children’s literature typically endorses heterosexuality through its invisible presence as the de facto sexual identity of countless protagonists and their families, yet heterosexuality’s ubiquity is counterbalanced by its occlusion when authors shield their readers from forthright considerations of one of humanity’s most basic and primal instincts. The book demonstrates that tensions between innocence and sexuality render much of children’s literature queer, especially when these texts disavow sexuality through celebrations of innocence. In this original study, Pugh develops interpretations of sexuality that few critics have yet ventured, paving the way for future scholarly engagement with larger questions about the ideological role of children's literature and representations of children's sexuality. Tison Pugh is Associate Professor in the Department of English at the University of Central Florida. He is the author of Queering Medieval Genres and Sexuality and Its Queer Discontents in Middle English Literature and has published on children’s literature in such journals as Children’s Literature, The Lion and the Unicorn, and Marvels and Tales.",['Literary Criticism']
"C.S. Lewis—On the Christ of a Religious Economy, 3.2",['P. H. Brazier'],"C. S. Lewis--On the Christ of a Religious Economy. II. Knowing Salvation, opens with a discussion of the Anscombe-Lewis debate (the theological issues relating to revelation and reason, Christ the Logos). This leads into Lewis on the Church (the body of Christ) and his understanding of religion: how is salvation enacted through the churches, how do we know we are saved? This concludes with, for Lewis, the question of sufferance and atonement, substitution and election, deliverance and redemption: heaven, hell, resurrection, and eternity--Christ's work of salvation on the cross. What did Lewis say of humanity in relation to God, now Immanuel, God with us, incarnate, crucified, resurrected, and ascended for humanity? What of Lewis's own death, and that of his wife?

By Any Other Name,['James G. Abernathy'],"Have you ever wondered . . . . . . what a worldview is, and why it's so important? . . . how liberal and conservative Christians both claim the Bible as their foundation? . . . why different worldviews attempt to solve the same problems in different ways? . . . how two people who formally espouse different worldviews can agree on so many issues? . . . why secularism is just as ""religious"" as Christianity? . . . why secularism has its own mythology? . . . why secularists want to silence Christianity in America's legislatures, courts, schools and churches? . . . why education is nearly always offered as a solution to society's ills (and why it won't work)? . . . how to formulate positions on contemporary issues not directly mentioned in the Bible? . . . why Christians are often ineffective at influencing culture? Abernathy answers these questions (and many more) by examining the relationship between ideas and their real-world consequences. This foundational relationship is key to understanding secularism, to understanding why its attempts to solve society's problems produce disastrous real-world consequences, and how its ideas infiltrate the biblical principles of even the most committed Christians. Abernathy sifts through the deceptive language of secular orthodoxy and shows how secularism ""by any other name"" still has tragic real-world consequences. Ideologies such as humanism, postmodernism, and liberal Christianity are exposed as repackaged havens of a failed worldview. Seemingly well-intentioned notions such as ""progressive education,"" pacifist foreign policy, ""tolerance,"" and wealth redistribution are debunked as deceptive myths peddled by an impoverished faith. By Any Other Name shatters the secular barrier erected to exclude Christianity from the marketplace of ideas and lays the groundwork for engaging a culture contaminated by secular mythology.",['Religion']

Westeros,"['George R.R. Martin', 'Elio M. Garcia, Jr.', 'Linda Antonsson']","Um eine fantastische Welt lebendig erscheinen zu lassen, benötigt sie eine Vergangenheit.

Dieser prachtvoll ausgestattete Bildband präsentiert erstmals die Geschichte von Westeros – beginnend in der Zeit, in der die ersten Menschen den Kontinent betraten, über die Ankunft von Aegon dem Eroberer und seinen Drachen bis zu Robert Baratheons Rebellion gegen den wahnsinnigen König Aerys II.

"Die Philosophie bei ""Game of Thrones""",['Henry Jacoby'],"Wenn eine Geschichte jemals nach einer philosophischen Betrachtung verlangt hat, dann ist es ""Das Lied von Eis und Feuer"". Denn nie waren Intrigen, Politik und Macht komplexer und spannender miteinander verstrickt als in diesem Fantasy-Epos. George R. R. Martin lehnt die klassische Rollenaufteilung von Protagonisten gegen Antagonisten ab. Gerade weil es in dieser Geschichte keine klassische Unterteilung in Gut und Böse gibt, ist eine philosophische Untersuchung der Beweggründe der Personen für ihr Handeln interessant. Ist Familie oder Rache wichtiger? Wer sollte die Sieben Königreiche regieren? Darf man um der Ehre willen einen Krieg riskieren? Warum sollte der Gewinner des Throns noch moralisch handeln? ""Die Philosophie bei Game of Thrones"" beantwortet all diese Fragen mit Hilfe der Theorien von Aristoteles, Plato, Descartes und Machiavelli. Das Buch eignet sich hervorragend als Einführung in die verschiedenen philosophischen Theorien und gibt einen tieferen Einblick in die Welt von Game of Thrones.",['Philosophy']
George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones 5-Book Boxed Set (Song of Ice and Fire Series),['George R. R.

An immersive entertainment experience unlike any other, A Song of Ice and Fire has earned George R. R. Martin—dubbed “the American Tolkien” by Time magazine—international acclaim and millions of loyal readers. Now this bundle collects the entire monumental cycle in the most convenient format available: A GAME OF THRONES A CLASH OF KINGS A STORM OF SWORDS A FEAST FOR CROWS A DANCE WITH DRAGONS “One of the best series in the history of fantasy.”—Los Angeles Times Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King’s Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert’s name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse—unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season. Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen’s brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister—the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki—whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys. “Long live George Martin . . . a literary dervish, enthralled by complicated characters and vivid language, and bursting with the wild vision of the very best tale tellers.”—The New York Times",['Fiction']

Glaubenskultur und Lebenskunst,['Wilfried Engemann'],"English summary: Glaubenskultur und Lebenskunst"" (culture of faith and the art of living) and addresses many issues crucial to contemporary theology. Focusing on the life-promoting aspects of traditions, contents and forms of religious practice of Christianity, it highlights anthropological premises and perspectives, which also affect the conception of religious services, the interpretation of biblical scriptures or the understanding of human freedom. Christian Theology should make the category of ""a life of faith"" plausible in such a way that people are not forced to choose between enjoying being human or being religious, but experience to appear as human beings through faith. Given the many burdens that Christian culture of faith is charged with - ranging from naive fundamentalism to a self-destructive religious practice - it is the task of theology - in dialogue with other humanities and life sciences - to make a ""life of faith"" credible as an ethically reasonable category of human existence that corresponds to human dignity and strengthens human freedom. German description: Dieser Band behandelt Fragen, die fur eine zeitgenossische Theologie von grossem Gewicht sind. Die Beitrage stellen die Lebensdienlichkeit der Traditionen, Inhalte und Formen der religiosen Praxis des Christentums in den Mittelpunkt der Betrachtung. Damit kommen anthropologische Pramissen und Perspektiven in den Blick, die auch die Konzeption von Gottesdiensten, die Auslegung biblischer Texte oder das Verstandnis menschlicher Freiheit betreffen.

Medievalism in A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones,['Shiloh Carroll'],"Game of Thrones is famously inspired by the Middle Ages - but how ""authentic"" is the world it presents? This volume offers different angles to the question. One of the biggest attractions of George R.R. Martin's high fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire, and by extension its HBO television adaptation, Game of Thrones, is its claim to historical realism. The author, thedirectors and producers of the adaptation, and indeed the fans of the books and show, all lay claim to Westeros, its setting, as representative of an authentic medieval world. But how true are these claims? Is it possible to faithfully represent a time so far removed from our own in time and culture? And what does an authentic medieval fantasy world look like? This book explores Martin's and HBO's approaches to and beliefs about the Middle Ages and how those beliefs fall into traditional medievalist and fantastic literary patterns. Examining both books and programme from a range of critical approaches - medievalism theory, gender theory, queer theory, postcolonial theory, andrace theory - Dr Carroll analyzes how the drive for historical realism affects the books' and show's treatment of men, women, people of colour, sexuality, and imperialism, as well as how the author and showrunners discuss these effects outside the texts themselves. SHILOH CARROLL teaches in the writing center at Tennessee State University.",['Literary Criticism']
Interdisciplinary Essays on Cannibalism,['Giulia Champion'],"Interdisciplinary Essays on Cannibalism: Bites Here and There brings together a range of works exploring the evolution of cannibalism, literally and metaphorically, diachronically and across disciplines. This edited collection aims to promote a conversation on the evolution and the different uses of the tropes and figures of cannibalism, in order to understand and deconstruct the fascination with anthropophagy, its continued afterlife and its relation to different disciplines and spaces of discourse. In order to do so, the contributing authors shed a new light not only on the concept, but also propose to explore cannibalism through new optics and theories. Spanning 15 chapters, the collection explores cannibalism across disciplines and fields from Antiquity to contemporary speculative fiction, considering history, anthropology, visual and film studies, philosophy, feminist theories, psychoanalysis and museum practices. This collection of thoughtful and thought-provoking scholarly contributions suggests the importance of cannibalism in understanding human history and social relations.",['Literary Criticism']
Fantasy and Myth in the Anthropocene,"['Marek Oziewicz', 'Brian Attebery', 'Tereza Dedinová']","The first study to look at the intersection of the discourse of the Anthropocene within the two highly influential storytelling modes of fantasy and myth, this book shows the need for stories that articulate visions of a biocentric, ecological civilization. Fantasy and myth have long been humanity's most advanced technologies for collective dreaming. Today they are helping us adopt a biocentric lens, re-kin us with other forms of life, and assist us in the transition to an ecological civilization. Deliberately moving away from dystopian narratives toward anticipatory imaginations of sustainable futures, this volume blends chapters by top scholars in the fields of fantasy, myth, and Young Adult literature with personal reflections by award-winning authors and illustrators of books for young audiences, including Shaun Tan, Jane Yolen, Katherine Applegate and Joseph Bruchac. Chapters cover the works of major fantasy authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Terry Prachett, J. K. Rowling, China Miéville, Barbara Henderson, Jeanette Winterson, John Crowley, Richard Powers, George R. R. Martin and Kim Stanley Robinson. They range through narratives set in the UK, USA, Nigeria, Ghana, Pacific Islands, New Zealand and Australia. Across the chapters, fantasy and myth are framed as spaces where visions of sustainable futures can be designed with most detail and nuance. Rather than merely criticizing the ecocidal status quo, the book asks how mythic narratives and fantastic stories can mobilize resistance around ideas necessary for the emergence of an ecological civilization.",['Literary Criticism']

The History Behind Game of Thrones,['David C. Weinczok'],"The true history behind the hit HBO fantasy show and George R. R. Martin’s bestselling Fire and Ice series. A wall in the distant north cuts the world in two. Ruthless sea-born warriors raid the coasts from their war galleys. A young nobleman and his kin are slaughtered under a banner of truce within a mighty castle. A warrior king becomes a legend when he smites his foe with one swing of his axe during a nation-forging battle. Yet this isn’t Westeros—it’s Scotland. Game of Thrones is history re-imagined as fantasy. The History Behind Game of Thrones turns the tables, using George R. R. Martin’s extraordinary fictional universe as a way to understand the driving forces and defining moments from Scotland’s story. Why were castles so important? Was there a limit to the powers a medieval king could use—or abuse? What was the reality of being under siege? Was there really anything that can compare to the destructive force of dragons? By joining forces, Westeros and Scotland hold the answers. Writer and presenter David C. Weinczok draws on a vast array of characters, events, places, and themes from Scottish history that echo Game of Thrones at every dramatic turn. Visit the castle where the real Red Wedding transpired, encounter the fearsome historical tribes beyond Rome’s great wall, learn how a blood-red heart became the most feared sigil in Scotland, and much more. By journey’s end, the cogs in the wheels of Martin’s world and Scottish history will be laid bare, as well as the stories of those who tried to shape—and sometimes even break—them.",['Social Science']
Queenship and the Women of Westeros,"['Zita Eva Rohr', 'Lisa Benz']","Is the world of George R. R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire and HBO’s Game of Thrones really medieval? How accurately does it reflect the real Middle Ages? Historians have been addressing these questions since the book and television series exploded into a cultural phenomenon. For scholars of medieval and early modern women, they offer a unique vantage point from which to study the intersections of elite women and popular understandings of the premodern world. This volume is a wide-ranging study of those intersections. Focusing on female agency and the role of advice, it finds a wealth of continuities and contrasts between the many powerful female characters of Martin’s fantasy world and the strategies that historical women used to exert influence. Reading characters such as Daenerys Targaryen, Cersei Lannister, and Brienne of Tarth with a creative, deeply scholarly eye, Queenship and the Women of Westeros makes cutting-edge developments in queenship studies accessible to everyday readers and fans.",['History']

Game of Thrones versus History,['Brian A. Pavlac'],"Since it first aired in 2011, Game of Thrones galloped up the ratings to become the most watched show in HBO’s history. It is no secret that creator George R.R. Martin was inspired by late 15th century Europe when writing A Song of Ice and Fire, the sprawling saga on which the show is based. Aside from the fantastical elements, Game of Thrones really does mirror historic events and bloody battles of medieval times—but how closely? Game of Thrones versus History: Written in Blood is a collection of thought-provoking essays by medieval historians who explore how the enormously popular HBO series and fantasy literature of George R. R. Martin are both informed by and differ significantly from real historical figures, events, beliefs, and practices of the medieval world. From a variety of perspectives, the authors delve into Martin’s plots, characterizations, and settings, offering insights into whether his creations are historical possibilities or pure flights of fantasy. Topics include the Wars of the Roses, barbarian colonizers, sieges and the nature of medieval warfare, women and agency, slavery, celibate societies in Westeros, myths and legends of medieval Europe, and many more. While life was certainly not a game during the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones versus History: Written in Blood reveals how a surprising number of otherworldly elements of George R. R. Martin’s fantasy are rooted deeply in the all-too-real world of medieval Europe.

Shakespeare and Game of Thrones,['Jeffrey R. Wilson'],"It is widely acknowledged that the hit franchise Game of Thrones is based on the Wars of the Roses, a bloody fifteenth-century civil war between feuding English families. In this book, Jeffrey R. Wilson shows how that connection was mediated by Shakespeare, and how a knowledge of the Shakespearean context enriches our understanding of the literary elements of Game of Thrones. On the one hand, Shakespeare influenced Game of Thrones indirectly because his history plays significantly shaped the way the Wars of the Roses are now remembered, including the modern histories and historical fictions George R.R. Martin drew upon. On the other, Game of Thrones also responds to Shakespeare’s first tetralogy directly by adapting several of its literary strategies (such as shifting perspectives, mixed genres, and metatheater) and tropes (including the stigmatized protagonist and the prince who was promised). Presenting new interviews with the Game of Thrones cast, and comparing contextual circumstances of composition—such as collaborative authorship and political currents—this book also lodges a series of provocations about writing and acting for the stage in the Elizabethan age and for the screen in the twenty-first century. An essential read for fans of the franchise, as well as students and academics looking at Shakespeare and Renaissance literature in the context of modern media.",['History']

Horror Literature through History,['Matt Cardin'],"This two-volume set offers comprehensive coverage of horror literature that spans its deep history, dominant themes, significant works, and major authors, such as Stephen King, Edgar Allan Poe, and Anne Rice, as well as lesser-known horror writers. Many of today's horror story fans—who appreciate horror through movies, television, video games, graphic novels, and other forms—probably don't realize that horror literature is not only one of the most popular types of literature but one of the oldest. People have always been mesmerized by stories that speak to their deepest fears. Horror Literature through History shows 21st-century horror fans the literary sources of their favorite entertainment and the rich intrinsic value of horror literature in its own right. Through profiles of major authors, critical analyses of important works, and overview essays focused on horror during particular periods as well as on related issues such as religion, apocalypticism, social criticism, and gender, readers will discover the fascinating early roots and evolution of horror writings as well as the reciprocal influence of horror literature and horror cinema. This unique two-volume reference set provides wide coverage that is current and compelling to modern readers—who are of course also eager consumers of entertainment. In the first section, overview essays on horror during different historical periods situate works of horror literature within the social, cultural, historical, and intellectual currents of their respective eras, creating a seamless narrative of the genre's evolution from ancient times to the present. The second section demonstrates how otherwise unrelated works of horror have influenced each other, how horror subgenres have evolved, and how a broad range of topics within horror—such as ghosts, vampires, religion, and gender roles—have been handled across time. The set also provides alphabetically arranged reference entries on authors, works, and specialized topics that enable readers to zero in on information and concepts presented in the other sections.",['Literary Criticism']
From Medievalism to Early-Modernism,"['Marina Gerzic', 'Aidan Norrie']","From Medievalism to Early-Modernism: Adapting the English Past is a collection of essays that both analyses the historical and cultural medieval and early modern past, and engages with the medievalism and early-modernism—a new term introduced in this collection—present in contemporary popular culture. By focusing on often overlooked uses of the past in contemporary culture—such as the allusions to John Webster’s The Duchess of Malfi (1623) in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books, and the impact of intertextual references and internet fandom on the BBC’s The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses—the contributors illustrate how cinematic, televisual, artistic, and literary depictions of the historical and cultural past not only re-purpose the past in varying ways, but also build on a history of adaptations that audiences have come to know and expect. From Medievalism to Early-Modernism: Adapting the English Past analyses the way that the medieval and early modern periods are used in modern adaptations, and how these adaptations both reflect contemporary concerns, and engage with a history of intertextuality and intervisuality.",['Biography & Autobiography']
The Ballad of the Lone Medievalist,"['Kisha G. Tracy', 'John P. Sexton']","Working medievalists are often the only scholar of the Middle Ages in a department, a university, or a hundred-mile radius. While working to build a body of focused scholarly work, the lone medievalist is expected to be a generalist in the classroom and a contributing member of a campus community that rarely offers disciplinary community in return. As a result, overtasked and single medievalists often find it challenging to advocate for their work and field. As other responsibilities and expectations crowd in, we come to feel disconnected from the projects and subjects that sustain our intellectual passion. An insidious isolation even from one another creeps in, and soon, even attending a conference of fellow medievalists can become a lonely experience. Surrounded by scholars with greater institutional support, lower teaching loads, or more robust research agendas, we may feel alienated from our work - the work to which we've dedicated our careers. The Lone Medievalist (the collaborative community and the book) is intended as an antidote to the problem of professional isolation. It is offered in the spirit of common weal that marks the ideals (if not always the realities) of so many of the communities we study - agricultural, professional, national, notional, and of course, monastic. The Ballad of the Lone Medievalist isn't only about scholarship, or teaching, or institutional life, or the pursuit of new learning - it's about all of them. The essays in this volume address all aspects of the professional and intellectual life of medievalists. Though many of us acknowledge and address the challenges in being Lone Medievalists, these essays are not intended as voces clamantium; they are offered to provide strategies, camaraderie, and an occasional bit of inspiration. They are a call to action, a sharing of hard-won wisdom, and a helping hand - and, above all, a reminder that we are not alone.",['Biography & Autobiography']

George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones Leather-Cloth Boxed Set (Song of Ice and Fire Series),['George R. R.

An immersive entertainment experience unlike any other, A Song of Ice and Fire has earned George R. R. Martin--dubbed ""the American Tolkien"" by Time magazine--international acclaim and millions of loyal readers. Now the monumental saga gets the royal treatment it deserves, with each book wrapped in bound leather-cloth covers and packaged together in an elegant display case. This one-of-a-kind boxed set includes: A GAME OF THRONES A CLASH OF KINGS A STORM OF SWORDS A FEAST FOR CROWS A DANCE WITH DRAGONS ""One of the best series in the history of fantasy.""--Los Angeles Times Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King's Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert's name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse--unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season. Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister--the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki--whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys. ""Long live George Martin . . . a literary dervish, enthralled by complicated characters and vivid language, and bursting with the wild vision of the very best tale tellers.""--The New York Times",['Fiction']

This volume represents the first sustained scholarly treatment of George R.R. Martin's groundbreaking work, and includes writing by experts involved in the production of the HBO show. The contributors investigate a number of compelling areas, including the mystery of the shape-shifting wargs, the conflict between religions, the origins of the Dothraki language and the sex lives of knights.

Game of Thrones - A View from the Humanities Vol. 1,"['Alfonso Álvarez-Ossorio', 'Fernando Lozano', 'Rosario Moreno Soldevila', 'Cristina Rosillo-Lopez']","This book reflects on time, space and culture in the Game of Thrones universe. It analyses both the novels and the TV series from a multidisciplinary perspective ultimately aimed at highlighting the complexity, eclecticism and diversity that characterises Martin’s world. The book is divided into three thematic sections. The first section focuses on space—both the urban and natural environment—and the interaction between human beings and their surroundings. The second section follows different yet complementary approaches to Game of Thrones from an aesthetic and cultural perspective. The final section addresses the linguistic and translation implications of the Game of Thrones universe, as well as its didactic uses.

The Vikings Reimagined,"['Tom Birkett', 'Roderick Dale']","The Vikings Reimagined explores the changing perception of Norse and Viking cultures across different cultural forms, and the complex legacy of the Vikings in the present day. Bringing together experts in literature, history and heritage engagement, this highly interdisciplinary collection aims to reconsider the impact of the discipline of Old Norse Viking Studies outside the academy and to broaden our understanding of the ways in which the material and textual remains of the Viking Age are given new meanings in the present. The diverse collection draws attention to the many roles that the Vikings play across contemporary culture: from the importance of Viking tourism, to the role of Norse sub-cultures in the formation of local and international identities. Together these collected essays challenge the academy to rethink its engagement with popular reiterations of the Vikings and to reassess the position afforded to ‘reception’ within the discipline.",['History']
The Palgrave Handbook of Contemporary Gothic,['Clive Bloom'],"“Simply put, there is absolutely nothing on the market with the range of ambition of this strikingly eclectic collection of essays. Not only is it impossible to imagine a more comprehensive view of the subject, most readers – even specialists in the subject – will find that there are elements of the Gothic genre here of which they were previously unaware.” - Barry Forshaw, Author of British Gothic Cinema and Sex and Film The Palgrave Handbook of Contemporary Gothic is the most comprehensive compendium of analytic essays on the modern Gothic now available, covering the vast and highly significant period from 1918 to 2019. The Gothic sensibility, over 200 years old, embraces its dark past whilst anticipating the future. From demons and monsters to post- apocalyptic fears and ecological fantasies, Gothic is thriving as never before in the arts and in popular culture. This volume is made up of 62 comprehensive chapters with notes and extended bibliographies contributed by scholars from around the world. The chapters are written not only for those engaged in academic research but also to be accessible to students and dedicated followers of the genre. Each chapter is packed with analysis of the Gothic in both theory and practice, as the genre has mutated and spread over the last hundred years. Starting in 1918 with the impact of film on the genre's development, and moving through its many and varied international incarnations, each chapter chronicles the history of the gothic milieu from the movies to gaming platforms and internet memes, television and theatre. The volume also looks at how Gothic intersects with fashion, music and popular culture: a multi-layered, multi-ethnic, even a trans-gendered experience as we move into the twenty first century.",['Social Science']
Women in Game of Thrones,['Valerie Estelle Frankel'],"Game of Thrones, one of the hottest series on television, leaves hundreds of critics divided on how ""feminist"" the show really is. Certainly the female characters, strong and weak, embody a variety of archetypes--widow queens, warrior women, damsels in distress, career women, priestesses, crones, mothers and maidens. However, the problem is that most of them play a single role without nuance--even the ""strong women"" have little to do besides strut about as one-note characters. This book analyzes the women and their portrayals one by one, along with their historical inspirations. Accompanying issues in television studies also appear, from the male gaze to depiction of race. How these characters are treated in the series and how they treat themselves becomes central, as many strip for the pleasure of men or are sacrificed as pawns. Some nude scenes or moments of male violence are fetishized and filmed to tantalize, while others show the women's trauma and attempt to identify with the scene's female perspective. The key is whether the characters break out of their traditional roles and become multidimensional.",['Performing Arts']
Medievalism in Play,['Karl Fugelso'],"Though manifestations of play represent a burgeoning subject area in the study of post-medieval responses to the Middle Ages, they have not always received the respect and attention they deserve. This volume seeks to correct those deficiencies. Though manifestations of play represent a burgeoning subject area in the study of post-medieval responses to the Middle Ages, they have not always received the respect and attention they deserve. This volume seeks to correct those deficiencies via six essays that directly address how the Middle Ages have been put in play with regard to Alice Munro's 1977 short story ""The Beggar Maid""; David Lowery's 2021 film The Green Knight; medievalist archaisms in Japanese video games; runic play in Norse-themed digital games; medievalist managerialism in the 2020 video game Crusader Kings III; and neomedieval architectural praxis in the 2014 video game Stronghold: Crusader II. The approaches and conclusions of those essays are then tested in the second section's six essays as they examine ""muscular medievalism"" in George R. R. Martin's 1996 novel A Game of Thrones; the queering of the Arthurian romance pattern in the 2018-20 television show She-Ra and the Princesses of Power; the interspecies embodiment of dis/ability in the 2010 film How to Train Your Dragon; late-nineteenth and early twentieth-century nationalism in Irish reimaginings of the Fenian Cycle; post-bellum medievalism in poetry of the Confederacy; and the medievalist presentation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 2020-21 Covid inoculation.",['History']

From Page to Screen / Vom Buch zum Film,"['Manuel Almagro-Jiménez', 'Eva Parra-Membrives']","For a long time now, women have struggled for the vindication of their rights and for their visibility. This struggle may seem a story of success, maybe not complete or equal for all women, but at least one which slowly but surely carries with it the promise of equality for all women. However, a closer look reveals that in various fields of culture the representation of women frequently undergoes a manipulation which makes the image of women lose the intention initially attempted. This is often the case with adaptations of literary texts to the screen, when the initial literary message is changed because of, for example, marketing demands or some ideological stance. Rarely do we find the opposite case where the indifferent or emasculated original female characters are turned into guardians and/or apologists of feminine power. The present volume focuses precisely on the way in which the image of women is modified in films and TV series, when compared with the original literary texts.",['Literary Criticism']
Second Person,"['Pat Harrigan', 'Noah Wardrip-Fruin']","Game designers, authors, artists, and scholars discuss how roles are played and how stories are created in role-playing games, board games, computer games, interactive fictions, massively multiplayer games, improvisational theater, and other ""playable media."" Games and other playable forms, from interactive fictions to improvisational theater, involve role playing and story—something played and something told. In Second Person, game designers, authors, artists, and scholars examine the different ways in which these two elements work together in tabletop role-playing games (RPGs), computer games, board games, card games, electronic literature, political simulations, locative media, massively multiplayer games, and other forms that invite and structure play. Second Person—so called because in these games and playable media it is ""you"" who plays the roles, ""you"" for whom the story is being told—first considers tabletop games ranging from Dungeons & Dragons and other RPGs with an explicit social component to Kim Newman's Choose Your Own Adventure-style novel Life's Lottery and its more traditional author-reader interaction. Contributors then examine computer-based playable structures that are designed for solo interaction—for the singular ""you""—including the mainstream hit Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and the genre-defining independent production Façade. Finally, contributors look at the intersection of the social spaces of play and the real world, considering, among other topics, the virtual communities of such Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) as World of Warcraft and the political uses of digital gaming and role-playing techniques (as in The Howard Dean for Iowa Game, the first U.S. presidential campaign game). In engaging essays that range in tone from the informal to the technical, these writers offer a variety of approaches for the examination of an emerging field that includes works as diverse as George R.R. Martin's Wild Cards series and the classic Infocom game Planetfall. Appendixes contain three fully-playable tabletop RPGs that demonstrate some of the variations possible in the form.",['Social Science']
Envisioning Legality,"['Timothy Peters', 'Karen Crawley']","Envisioning Legality: Law, Culture and Representation is a path-breaking collection of some of the world’s leading cultural legal scholars addressing issues of law, representation and the image. Law is constituted in and through the representations that hold us in their thrall, and this book focuses on the ways in which cultural legal representations not only reflect or contribute to an understanding of law, but constitute the very fabric of legality itself. As such, each of these ‘readings’ of cultural texts takes seriously the cultural as a mode of envisioning, constituting and critiquing the law. And the theoretically sophisticated approaches utilised here encompass more than simply an engagement with ‘harmless entertainment’. Rather they enact and undertake specific political and critical engagements with timely issues, such as: the redressing of past wrongs; recognising and combatting structural injustices; and orienting our political communities in relation to uncertain futures. Envisioning Legality thereby presents a cultural legal studies that provides the means for engaging in robust, sustained and in-depth encounters with the nature and role of law in a global, mediated world.",['Law']

Beyond the meanings conveyed by representations of the monstrous, however, the central question of all works of fiction that use this resource in the realm of the fantastic is also that of the role of man and the task he sets himself as creator and, therefore, as a true monster, according to the etymological meaning of the Latin -monstrum: something unusual, exceptional or a prodigy contrary to the natural order-.

In addition to the book that kicks off A Song of Ice of Fire, this eBook bundle includes Dreamsongs: Volume I, which showcases Martin’s early writings; Fevre Dream, the acclaimed author’s reinvention of the vampire novel; and The Armageddon Rag, a thrilling story of psychedelic—and apocalyptic—rock. Spanning genres of fantasy, science fiction, horror, and suspense, Martin’s virtuosic talents will surprise and delight even his most devoted fans. A GAME OF THRONES “The only fantasy series I’d put on a level with J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings . . . It’s a fantasy series for hip, smart people, even those who don’t read fantasy.”—Chicago Tribune In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. As sinister forces mass beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser is dead and his enemies are emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself. DREAMSONGS: VOLUME I “The ideal way to discover . . . a master of science fiction, fantasy and horror. . . . Martin is a writer like no other.”—The Guardian (U.K.) Gathered here are the very best of Martin’s early works, including his Hugo, Nebula, and Bram Stoker award–winning stories, cool fan pieces, and the original novella The Ice Dragon, from which his New York Times bestselling children’s book of the same title originated. With extensive author commentary, Dreamsongs: Volume I is a rare treat, offering fascinating insights into Martin’s journey from young writer to award-winning master. FEVRE DREAM “An adventure into the heart of darkness that transcends even the most inventive vampire novels.”—Los Angeles Herald Examiner Abner Marsh, a struggling riverboat captain, suspects that something’s amiss when he is approached by a wealthy aristocrat with a lucrative offer. The hauntingly pale, steely-eyed Joshua York doesn’t care that the icy winter of 1857 has wiped out all but one of Marsh’s dilapidated fleet. Not until the maiden voyage of Fevre Dream does Marsh realize that he has joined a mission both more sinister, and perhaps more noble, than his most fantastic nightmare—and humankind’s most impossible dream. THE ARMAGEDDON RAG “The best novel concerning the American pop music culture of the sixties I’ve ever read.”—Stephen King Onetime underground journalist Sandy Blair has come a long way from his radical roots in the sixties—until he’s drawn back by the bizarre and brutal murder of a rock promoter who made millions with a band called the Nazgûl. As Sandy investigates the crime, he finds himself drawn back into his own past. For a new messiah has resurrected the Nazgûl along with a requiem of demonism, mind control, and death, whose apocalyptic tune only Sandy may be able to change.",['Fiction']

Shakespeare and Tourism,"['Robert Ormsby', 'Valerie Clayman Pye']","Shakespeare and Tourism provides a dialogical mapping of Shakespeare studies and touristic theory through a collection of essays by scholars on a wide range of material. This volume examines how Shakespeare tourism has evolved since its inception, and how the phenomenon has been influenced and redefined by performance studies, the prevalence of the World Wide Web, developments in technology, and the globalization of Shakespearean performance. Current scholarship recognizes Shakespearean tourism as a thriving international industry, the result of centuries of efforts to attribute meanings associated with the playwright’s biography and literary prestige to sites for artistic pilgrimage and the consumption of cultural heritage. Through bringing Shakespeare and tourism studies into more explicit contact, this collection provides readers with a broad base for comparisons across time and location, and thereby encourages a thorough reconsideration of how we understand both fields.",['Drama']

A+ Parenting,"['Eva Moskowitz', 'Eric Grannis']","Eva Moskowitz, founder of the highly lauded Success Academy Charter Schools, shares her advice for raising smart, successful, and intellectually engaged children. Eva Moskowitz has built a national reputation as the founder and leader of Success Academy Charter Schools, one of the country’s most highly regarded networks of schools, but while most people know Eva for her success in educating 20,000 mainly low-income students who are routinely accepted to our nation’s best universities, she has also been responsible for raising three children of her own. In A+ Parenting, Eva shares what she has learned both as a parent and an educator about raising children to be enthusiastic and successful learners. Eva’s most important message is that parents can and should play a critical role in their children’s intellectual development. Each year, children only spend about 180 days in school; how they spend the remaining 185 days is up to their parents. Children who continue to learn when they are out of school will make far more progress than those who don’t, but parents need not attempt to recreate school at home. Instead, they can encourage their children to engage in fun activities that will have a huge impact on their creativity, intellectual curiosity, and attention span. A+ Parenting is every parent’s must-have guide to enriching every aspect of a child’s life, from the morning carpool to the soccer field to the dinner table—without having to hire tutors or carve out more hours in the day. Moskowitz explains how to take the time you’re already spending with your children and make it more fulfilling and intellectually stimulating for them. The book is full of practical guidance such as: Which extracurricular activities are best for a child’s development. How children can learn by watching movies and playing games—and why you should reach for chess or Monopoly over checkers or Candyland. How to help your child overcome a learning disability and ensure it doesn’t undermine their self-confidence. Why getting angry at children doesn’t work but expressing disappointment does. In addition to advice, this book is filled with carefully curated lists of educational activities, including games to play, movies to watch, puzzles to solve, books to read, music to listen to, and experiments to perform. These activities, supported with love and joy, are all parents need to turn their children into lifelong learners.",['Family & Relationships']

The Art of Reading,['Damon Young'],"A beautiful celebratory tribute to the powers of one of our most undervalued skills — an ideal gift for the avid reader. ‘What you are doing right now is, cosmically speaking, against the odds.’ As young children, we are taught to read, but soon go on to forget just how miraculous a process it is, this turning of scratches and dots into understanding, unease and inspiration. Perhaps we need to stop and remember, stop and learn again how to read better. Damon Young shows us how to do exactly this, walking alongside some of the greatest readers who light a path for us — Borges, Plato, Woolf. Young reads passionately, selectively, surprisingly — from superhero noir to speculative realism, from Heidegger to Heinlein — and shows his reader how cultivating their inner critic can expand their own lives as well as the lives of those on the pages of the books they love.",['Philosophy']

"Sternenlieder, Schattenlieder","['Stefan Lorenz', 'Peter Robert']","Als Gegenstromung zur Aufklarung konstituierte sich im Verlauf des 19. Jahrhunderts die geistige Bewegung der Romantik, die sich ausdrucklich zu menschlichen Leidenschaften und zur Irrationalitat bekannte. Wie konnen solche Ideale aber ausgerechnet in einer Literaturgattung Gestalt annehmen, die im offentlichen Bewusstsein wie keine andere sonst als Sinnbild einer technokratischen ratio verstanden wird? Der 1948 geborene amerikanische Schriftsteller George R. R. Martin gibt darauf eine literarisch fruchtbare Antwort. Nicht etwa Spekulationen uber zukunftige technische Entwicklungen etwa in der Weltraumfahrt oder in der Computertechnologie bestimmen sein Werk, sondern die Frage, wie sich die menschliche Natur, der menschliche Charakter in das Szenarium einer fiktiven Zukunft einfugen konnte. Martin geht dabei nicht davon aus, dass sich der Mensch im Rahmen eines evolutionaren Prozesses zu einer hoheren Intelligenzform weiterentwickeln werde, sondern beschreibt ihn in all seinen Schwachen, Konflikten und Leidenschaften. Dabei nehmen seine Texte bisweilen dramatische Zuge an. Sein vielfaltiges Talent stellt George R. R. Martin allerdings nicht nur als Verfasser von Science-Fiction unter Beweis. Auch andere Spielarten der fantastischen Literatur (Horror, Fantasy) beherrscht er gekonnt.

How could it be otherwise? For every Frodo, there is a Gandalf . . . and a Saruman. For every Dorothy, a Glinda . . . and a Wicked Witch of the West.

Those infected either draw the black queen and die, draw an ace and receive superpowers, or draw the joker and are bizarrely mutated. Croyd Crenson is the Wild Card’s greatest failure—and its greatest success. Dubbed “The Sleeper,” he randomly undergoes hibernations that can span days, weeks, or even months. After each hibernation, he awakens with a new appearance and set of powers—sometimes a joker, sometimes an ace, and sometimes a combination of both—until exhaustion claims him and his next inevitable sleep shuffles the cards anew. Ever since his initial infection in 1946, he’s awoken in a singular body—until now. His latest awakening has left him split into six different incarnations, each of them a self-contained piece of the original and each with a unique look and ability. One of them, at least, recognizes this for the disaster that it is, and tasks the clever and elusive Tesla—a joker with ace powers—to locate and gather the remaining five versions of himself before sleep claims them again and leaves Croyd permanently fractured. What follows is a journey through Croyd’s long and colorful life, through the lens of some who have encountered the world’s most unusual wild carder. And as Tesla delves deeper into the investigation, he’ll have to work fast, because not every Croyd is as amiable as the first—and they’ll do whatever it takes to survive.

George R. R. Martin Presents Wild Cards: Sins of the Father,['Melinda M. Snodgrass'],"A cop on the trail of a bizarre murder uncovers a hidden conspiracy—and shocking secrets about his late father—in this original graphic novel set in George R. R. Martin’s shared-world universe, Wild Cards. In 1946, an alien virus ravaged the world, its results as random as a hand of cards. From that fateful moment to the present day, those infected either draw the black queen and die, draw an ace and receive superpowers, or draw the joker and are bizarrely mutated. Today, Aces, Jokers, and uninfected humans live in relative peace. Francis “Franny” Black is an uninfected human cop, trying to police a world filled with people with the extraordinary powers that he lacks. Newly—and some would say too suddenly—promoted to detective, he has been working out of Wild Card Central, the precinct in Jokertown where the bulk of the virus victims fell in 1946. Franny’s father was one of the heroes of the precinct, killed in the line of duty, and Franny is finding it hard to fill his dead father’s shoes. That is, until he’s given a particularly insidious case and starts uncovering long-buried secrets that his father might have died to protect. Illustrated in a gorgeous, cinematic style by Michael Komarck and Elizabeth Leggett, this unique graphic novel is a visual feast certain to delight.",['Comics & Graphic Novels']

In seinem ersten Fall nimmt Hercule Poirot alle Bewohner von Styles gründlich unter die Lupe, bis er das fehlende Glied in der Kette gefunden hat.

Zeugin der Anklage,['Agatha Christie'],"Der Theaterstück-Krimiklassiker von Agatha Christie Alles spricht gegen den Handelsvertreter Leonard Vole. Ihm wird vorgeworfen, die Witwe Emily French ermordet zu haben. Sein Motiv scheint eindeutig: Die ältere Dame hatte ihm ihr ganzes Vermögen vermacht. Strafverteidiger Sir Wilfried Robarts nimmt sich des Falles an und schlägt sich nicht schlecht. Ihm gelingt es durch geschicktes Verhör, die Aussagen der beiden ersten Zeugen in Zweifel zu ziehen. Doch die dritte und letzte Zeugin überrascht alle Anwesenden: Es ist Romaine Heilger – die Ehefrau des Angeklagten. Sie widerlegt sein angebliches Alibi. Außerdem stellt sich heraus, dass sie gar nicht mit Leonard verheiratet ist, da ihre frühere Ehe in Deutschland noch gar nicht geschieden war, als sie ihn heiratete. Immer enger wird die Schlinge um Leonards Hals. Am Abend vor der Urteilsverkündung meldet sich eine merkwürdige, im Gesicht entstellte Frau bei Sir Wilfrid, die ihm ein Bündel Briefe von Christine an einen gewissen Max verkauft. Darin schildert Romaine, wie sie eine Falschaussage plant, um ihren Mann loszuwerden und frei für Max zu sein. Durch dieses in letzter Minute vorgelegte neue Beweismaterial erreicht Sir Wilfrid einen Freispruch. Doch läuft das nicht alles zu glatt? Nach der Verhandlung wirft Sir Wilfried Romaine vor, Leonard absichtlich belastet zu haben. Sie gibt zu, dass die Briefe und auch die Frau mit der Narbe nur erlogen waren. Da sie noch immer in Leonard verliebt ist, hat sie alles nur vorgespielt, um ihn zu entlasten. In Wahrheit hat Leonard Emily French doch getötet. Eine junge Blondine betritt den Gerichtssaal, um Leonard abzuholen. Sie stellt sich als neue Freundin von Leonard vor. Blind vor Wut ersticht Romaine ihren Mann und wird sofort verhaftet.

Agatha Christie,['Barbara Sichtermann'],"Es gibt bislang keine Biografie über Agatha Christie aus deutscher Feder, die umfassender, aktueller und anspruchsvoller wäre. Agatha Christie zählt wahrscheinlich zu den am meisten unterschätzten Persönlichkeiten der schreibenden Zunft im 20. Jahrhundert – was ihr selbst aber nicht viel ausmachte, denn sie war, am Umsatz gemessen, sogar die erfolgreichste Autorin aller Zeiten mit geschätzten zwei Milliarden verkauften Büchern. Und je mehr Zeit vergeht, seit die große Dame des Kriminalromans 1976 verstarb, umso bereitwilliger revidieren jene Kritiker, die Christie einst als Trivialautorin links liegen gelassen hatten, ihr Urteil. Denn die Schriftstellerin konnte nicht nur ausgezeichnet erzählen, sondern lieferte auch eine Art Psycho- und Sozialchronik des 20. Jahrhunderts. Agatha Christies Leben war schon deshalb spannend, weil sie durch ihren Erfolg Zugang zu den großen Bühnen der Öffentlichkeit erhielt, mehr als eine Weltreise unternahm und sich an der Seite ihres zweiten Mannes Max Mallowan zur Hobby-Archäologin entwickelte. Das Interessanteste aber ist ihre Kunst, die menschliche Wahrnehmung im Spiegel einer Krimihandlung in all ihrer naiven Leichtgläubigkeit, aber auch ihrer natürlichen Skepsis zu charakterisieren. In ihrem Habitus blieb Agatha die reservierte viktorianische Lady, die aber in ihrem Wirken weit über das zu ihrer Zeit gültige Frauenleitbild hinauswuchs. In ihren beiden Ehen errang und wahrte sie ihre persönliche Unabhängigkeit – auch in Lebenssphären, in denen Ruhm und Geld keine Rolle mehr spielten. Ihre Vita zu erzählen und dabei ihr Werk zu würdigen war ein großer Ansporn für eine so erfolgreiche feministische Autorin wie Barbara Sichtermann.",['Biography & Autobiography']

Agatha Christie and the Guilty Pleasure of Poison,['Sylvia A.

In doing so, it uncovers an overlooked dynamic in which female poisoners deliver well-deserved comeuppance for gendered and classed wrongdoing ordinarily accepted in everyday life. While critics have long recognized male outlaws, like Robin Hood, who use crime to oppose a corrupt system, this book contends that female outlaws – witches and poisoners – offer a similar heritage of empowered femininity. Far from cozy and formulaic, Agatha Christie’s outlaw poisoners offer readers the surprising pleasures of comeuppance, and they set the stage for contemporary detective fiction writers, more recent films depicting poisoning as empowering, and even poison gardens, which are tourist destinations that offer visitors the guilty pleasure of poison.",['Literary Criticism']

Agatha Christie: A Biography (Creator of Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple),['Keely Bautista'],"This book is part of Hyperink's best little books series. This best little book is 3,800+ words of fast, entertaining information on a highly demanded topic. Based on reader feedback (including yours!), we may expand this book in the future. If we do so, we'll send a free copy to all previous buyers. ABOUT THE BOOK Agatha Christie's own life was, in many ways, as mysterious as those of her characters. Assuredly it was her predilection for the cryptic that led her to create the fiery-yet-unfathomable Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. Yet, while Poirot epitomizes the image of the enigmatic detective, his creator was just as inscrutable, making her own life a story worthy of a novel of its own. Agatha Christie's other great creation, Jane Marple, seems far more accessible, but she keeps her own counsel as well, a trait that Agatha Christie perfected in her own life. It came as no great surprise to her fans that, after her death, secrets from Christie's life suddenly tumbled out in the form of newly-discovered archived recordings she had made decades before. These recordings, completely unknown to the public, provide a new insight into her creations, and created a fascinating denouement that Agatha would have loved. Why have the writings of this exacting, rather reclusive author resonated with the public for so many generations? The secret is one that Agatha knew well: her stories are about people we can relate to in real life. As Hercule Poirot was fond of saying, everyone has the makings of a criminal in him; the key to success in life is in how we master those darker feelings. As we read an Agatha Christie novel, we realize that we ourselves could easily be one of the characters - and yes, even the murderer. EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK Other than its inventive plot, a major reason for the success of this first novel was the quirky yet captivating character of Hercule Poirot, who was inspired by the Belgian refugees living in England whom Agatha had met during the First World War. She recalled that they had a hard time understanding the British way of doing things, and preferred to assimilate as little of British life as possible. Throughout the 1920s Agatha completed to write, and produced one of her greatest successes, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, in 1926. This novel was a sensation with the reading public because of its unexpected and even shocking ending, and was so popular that it was made into a movie in 1931, Alibi, which marked the first film appearance of Hercule Poirot. The 1930s, however, proved to be Agatha's most productive time as a writer. During this decade she wrote a total of 14 Poirot novels and two Miss Marple novels, as well as two books featuring the character Superintendent Battle, two story collections featuring the characters Harley Quin and Mr. Parker Pyne, four additional mystery books, two plays and a novel under her pseudonym, Mary Westmacott...

Queering Agatha Christie,['J.C Bernthal'],"This book is the first fully theorized queer reading of a Golden Age British crime writer. Agatha Christie was the most commercially successful novelist of the twentieth century, and her fiction remains popular. She created such memorable characters as Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple, and has become synonymous with a nostalgic, conservative tradition of crime fiction. J.C. Bernthal reads Christie through the lens of queer theory, uncovering a playful, alert, and subversive social commentary. After considering Christie’s emergence in a commercial market hostile to her sex, in Queering Agatha Christie Bernthal explores homophobic stereotypes, gender performativity, queer children, and masquerade in key texts published between 1920 and 1952. Christie engaged with debates around human identity in a unique historical period affected by two world wars. The final chapter considers twenty-first century Poirot and Marple adaptations, with visible LGBT characters, and poses the question: might the books be queerer?",['Literary Criticism']

After Austen,['Lisa Hopkins'],"This collection of twelve new essays examines some of what Jane Austen has become in the two hundred years since her death. Some of the chapters explore adaptations or repurposings of her work while others trace her influence on a surprising variety of different kinds of writing, sometimes even when there is no announced or obvious debt to her. In so doing they also inevitably shed light on Austen herself. Austen is often considered romantic and not often considered political, but both those perceptions are challenged her, as is the idea that she is primarily a writer for and about women. Her books are comic and ironic, but they have been reworked and drawn upon in very different genres and styles. Collectively these essays testify to the extraordinary versatility and resonance of Austen’s books.",['Literary Criticism']

Empires of Antiquities,['Billie Melman'],"Empires of Antiquities is a history of the rediscovery of civilizations of the ancient Near East in the imperial order that evolved between the outbreak of the First World War and the 1950s. It explores the ways in which Near Eastern antiquity was redefined and experienced, becoming the subject of new regulation, new modes of knowledge, and international and local politics. A series of globally publicized spectacular archaeological discoveries in Iraq, Egypt, and Palestine, which the book follows, made antiquity visible, palpable and accessible as never before. The new uses of antiquity and its relations to modernity were inseparable from the emergence of the post-war world order, imperial collaboration and collisions, and national aspirations. Empires of Antiquities uniquely combines a history of the internationalization of a new ""regime of archaeology"" under the oversight of the League of Nations and its web of institutions, a history of British passions for Near Eastern antiquity, on-the-ground colonial mechanisms and nationalist claims on the past. It points to the centrality of the mandate system, particularly mandates classified A, in Mesopotamia/Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan, formerly governed by the Ottoman Empire, and of Egypt, in a new culture of antiquity. Drawing on an unusually wide range of archives in several countries, as well as on visual and material evidence, the book weaves together imperial, international, and local histories of institutions, people, ideas and objects and offers an entirely new interpretation of the history of archaeological discovery and its connections to empires and modernity.",['Social Science']

Popular Postcolonialisms,"['Nadia Atia', 'Kate Houlden']","Drawing together the insights of postcolonial scholarship and cultural studies, Popular Postcolonialisms questions the place of ‘the popular’ in the postcolonial paradigm. Multidisciplinary in focus, this collection explores the extent to which popular forms are infused with colonial logics, and whether they can be employed by those advocating for change. It considers a range of fiction, film, and non-hegemonic cultural forms, engaging with topics such as environmental change, language activism, and cultural imperialism alongside analysis of figures like Tarzan and Frankenstein. Building on the work of cultural theorists, it asks whether the popular is actually where elite conceptions of the world may best be challenged. It also addresses middlebrow cultural production, which has tended to be seen as antithetical to radical traditions, asking whether this might, in fact, form an unlikely realm from which to question, critique, or challenge colonial tropes. Examining the ways in which the imprint of colonial history is in evidence (interrogated, mythologized or sublimated) within popular cultural production, this book raises a series of speculative questions exploring the interrelation of the popular and the postcolonial.",['Literary Criticism']

Whatever Happened to Sherlock Holmes,['Robert S. Paul'],"Robert S. Paul suggests that the reason detective fiction has won legions of readers may be that ""the writer of detective fiction, without conscious intent, appeals directly to those moral and spiritual roots of society unconsciously affirmed and endorsed by the readers."" Because detective stories deal with crime and punishment they cannot help dealing implicitly with theological issues, such as the reality of good and evil, the recognition that humankind has the potential for both, the nature of evidence (truth and error), the significance of our existence in a rational order and hence the reality of truth, and the value of the individual in a civilized society. Paul argues that the genre traces its true beginning to the Enlightenment and documents two related but different reactions to the theological issues involved: first, a line of writers who are generally positive in relation to their cultural setting, such as Edgar Allan Poe, Wilkie Collins, Conan Doyle; and second, a reactionary strain, critical of the prevailing culture, that begins in William Godwin's Caleb Williams and continues through the anti-heroic writers like Arsène Lupin to Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, and John MacDonald.",['Literary Criticism']
Ladies of the Field,['Amanda Adams'],"The first women archaeologists were Victorian era adventurers who felt most at home when farthest from it. Canvas tents were their domains, hot Middle Eastern deserts their gardens of inquiry and labor. Thanks to them, prevailing ideas about feminine nature — soft, nurturing, submissive — were upended. Ladies of the Field tells the story of seven remarkable women, each a pioneering archaeologist, each headstrong, smart, and courageous, who burst into what was then a very young science.

The Villainous Stage,['Marvin Lachman'],"Live theatre was once the main entertainment medium in the United States and the United Kingdom. The preeminent dramatists and actors of the day wrote and performed in numerous plays in which crime was a major plot element. This remains true today, especially with the longest-running shows such as The Phantom of the Opera, Les Miserables and Sweeney Todd. While hundreds of books have been published about crime fiction in film and on television, the topic of stage mysteries has been largely unexplored. Covering productions from the 18th century to the 2013-2014 theatre season, this is the first history of crime plays according to subject matter. More than 20 categories are identified, including whodunits, comic mysteries, courtroom dramas, musicals, crook plays, social issues, Sherlock Holmes, and Agatha Christie. Nearly 900 plays are described, including the reactions of critics and audiences.",['Performing Arts']

In the Beginning,['Mary Jean DeMarr'],"Others concentrate more on analysis of the subject novel itself, indicating more briefly how that book relates to those which follow it. Some discuss such questions as what exactly is the first novel in some rather complex series and in several cases more than one initiating book is discussed. No attempt has been made to include consideration of a representative sample of the various types of detective series, but a variety of authors is covered, ranging from such classics as Agatha Christie, Rex Stout, and Dorothy L. Sayers, to more recent authors like James McClure, Joseph Hansen, and Colin Dexter.",['Fiction']
You Can Go Home Again,"['Tracey Laszloffy', 'Monica McGoldrick']","Are you ready to reconnect with family in a meaningful way, but unsure where or how to begin? This beloved classic poignantly explains how constructing the genogram, or a basic family tree, can help us to better understand and mend family relationships and dynamics. Readers learn how genograms can reveal a family’s history of estrangement, alliance, divorce, or suicide, exposing intergenerational patterns that prove more than coincidental. The book sheds light on a range of complex issues such as birth order and sibling rivalry, family myths and secrets, cultural differences, couple relationships, and the pivotal role of loss. In the third edition of this revelatory book, “godmother of genograms” Monica McGoldrick and family therapist Tracey Laszloffy focus on aiding readers in their own work to understand their family history and change their role in relationships where there is distance, conflict, or cutoff. Readers will also find new and updated material on the intergenerational transmission of trauma, the ramifications of uncovering family secrets via DNA testing, and more. If you’ve ever struggled to understand the complex dynamics of your family—and your place within it—this book is for you.",['Psychology']

And, two issues of Canadian legal process are argued as essays in the fi nal two chapters.",['Technology & Engineering']
Adapting Detective Fiction,['Neil McCaw'],"Adapting Detective Fiction is a study of specific instances of adaptation, with close readings of both the originating sources and adapted texts. But it is also more than this. It is a study of the politics of representation in the last decades of the twentieth century, and the role television detective fiction plays in this. It is about the mutually-informing interrelation of cultural texts and political rhetoric, about the connection between the popular-cultural depiction of crime and criminality and how we come to understand human behaviour and culpability; most of all, it is a detailed consideration of what the process of adaptation reveals about the shifting nature of the world in which we live. With specific reference to television series such as The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, Inspector Morse, A Touch of Frost, Cadfael, and Midsomer Murders, Adapting Detective Fiction uses adaptation as the basis for an exercise in later twentieth-century cultural history, illustrating the fundamental role detective fictions play in popular beliefs about the nature of crime and Englishness.",['Literary Criticism']

Critical Essays on English and Bengali Detective Fiction,['Debayan Deb Barman'],"Critical Essays on English and Bengali Detective Fiction brings together three strains of detective fiction: British, American, and Bengal. The import of detective fiction from Britain has influenced generations of writers of Bengali detective fiction. In this anthology of critical essays by scholars on detective fiction, we have divided the contents into three groups. First, there are essays on classic British detective fiction, with essays on Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, P.D.James, Kate Atkinson, and Margery Allingham. The second section is on American hard-boiled fiction with essays on Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. The third section is on Bengali detective fiction with essays on Hemendra Kumar Roy, Saradindu Bandyopadhay and Satyajit Ray. Together, these essays bring three strains of detective fiction into conversation to show the gradual postcolonial attempt of Bengali detective fiction to outgrow colonial influences and create an original and organic tradition of regional and vernacular detective fiction.",['Literary Criticism']
A Historical Dictionary of British Women,['Cathy Hartley'],"This reference book, containing the biographies of more than 1,100 notable British women from Boudicca to Barbara Castle, is an absorbing record of female achievement spanning some 2,000 years of British life. Most of the lives included are those of women whose work took them in some way before the public and who therefore played a direct and important role in broadening the horizons of women. Also included are women who influenced events in a more indirect way: the wives of kings and politicians, mistresses, ladies in waiting and society hostesses. Originally published as The Europa Biographical Dictionary of British Women, this newly re-worked edition includes key figures who have died in the last 20 years, such as The Queen Mother, Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, Elizabeth Jennings and Christina Foyle.",['History']
Murder in the Closet,['Curtis Evans'],"Before the 1969 Stonewall Riots, LGBTQ life was dominated by the negative image of ""the closet""--the metaphorical space where that which was deemed ""queer"" was hidden from a hostile public view. Literary studies of queer themes and characters in crime fiction have tended to focus on the more positive and explicit representations since the riots, while pre-Stonewall works are thought to reference queer only negatively or obliquely. This collection of new essays questions that view with an investigation of queer aspects in crime fiction published over eight decades, from the corseted Victorian era to the unbuttoned 1960s.",['Literary Criticism']

Pistols and Petticoats,['Erika Janik'],"A lively exploration of the struggles faced by women in law enforcement and mystery fiction for the past 175 years In 1910, Alice Wells took the oath to join the all-male Los Angeles Police Department. She wore no uniform, carried no weapon, and kept her badge stuffed in her pocketbook. She wasn’t the first or only policewoman, but she became the movement’s most visible voice. Police work from its very beginning was considered a male domain, far too dangerous and rough for a respectable woman to even contemplate doing, much less take on as a profession. A policewoman worked outside the home, walking dangerous city streets late at night to confront burglars, drunks, scam artists, and prostitutes. To solve crimes, she observed, collected evidence, and used reason and logic—traits typically associated with men. And most controversially of all, she had a purpose separate from her husband, children, and home. Women who donned the badge faced harassment and discrimination. It would take more than seventy years for women to enter the force as full-fledged officers. Yet within the covers of popular fiction, women not only wrote mysteries but also created female characters that handily solved crimes. Smart, independent, and courageous, these nineteenth- and early twentieth-century female sleuths (including a healthy number created by male writers) set the stage for Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple, Sara Paretsky’s V. I. Warshawski, Patricia Cornwell’s Kay Scarpetta, and Sue Grafton’s Kinsey Millhone, as well as TV detectives such as Prime Suspect’s Jane Tennison and Law and Order’s Olivia Benson. The authors were not amateurs dabbling in detection but professional writers who helped define the genre and competed with men, often to greater success. Pistols and Petticoats tells the story of women’s very early place in crime fiction and their public crusade to transform policing. Whether real or fictional, investigating women were nearly always at odds with society. Most women refused to let that stop them, paving the way to a modern professional life for women on the force and in popular culture.",['Social Science']
Onscreen Allusions to Shakespeare,"['Alexa Alice Joubin', 'Victoria Bladen']","Allusions to Shakespeare haunt our contemporary culture in a myriad of ways, whether through brief references or sustained intertextual engagements.

This collection of essays extends beyond a US-UK axis to bring together an international group of scholars to explore Shakespearean appropriations in unexpected contexts in lesser-known films and television shows in India, Brazil, Russia, France, Australia, South Africa, East-Central Europe and Italy, with reference to some filmed stage works.",['Literary Criticism']

Gender and Representation in British ‘Golden Age’ Crime Fiction,['Megan Hoffman'],"This book provides an original and compelling analysis of the ways in which British women’s golden age crime narratives negotiate the conflicting social and cultural forces that influenced depictions of gender in popular culture in the 1920s until the late 1940s. The book explores a wide variety of texts produced both by writers who have been the focus of a relatively large amount of critical attention, such as Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers and Margery Allingham, but also those who have received comparatively little, such as Christianna Brand, Ngaio Marsh, Gladys Mitchell, Josephine Tey and Patricia Wentworth. Through its original readings, this book explores the ambivalent nature of modes of femininity depicted in golden age crime fiction, and shows that seemingly conservative resolutions are often attempts to provide a ‘modern-yet-safe’ solution to the conflicts raised in the texts.",['Literary Criticism']

Secrets of Crime Fiction Classics,['Stephen Knight'],"Starting with William Godwin's Caleb Williams and Charles Brockden Brown's Edgar Huntly, this book covers in detail the great works of detective fiction--Poe's Dupin stories, Conan Doyle's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Christie's The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Sayers' Strong Poison, Chandler's The Big Sleep, and Simenon's The Yellow Dog. Lesser-known but important early works are also discussed, including Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White, Emile Gaboriau's M. Lecoq, Anna Katharine Green's The Leavenworth Case and Fergus Hume's The Mystery of a Hansom Cab. More recent titles show increasing variety in the mystery genre, with Patricia Highsmith's criminal-focused The Talented Mr. Ripley and Chester Himes' African-American detectives in Cotton Comes to Harlem. Diversity develops further in Sara Paretsky's tough woman detective V.I. Warshawski in Indemnity Only, Umberto Eco's medievalist and postmodern The Name of the Rose and the forensic feminism of Patricia Cornwell's Postmortem. Notably, the best modern crime fiction has been primarily international--Manuel Vasquez Montalban's Catalan Summer Seas, Ian Rankin's Edinburgh-set The Naming of the Dead, Sweden's Stieg Larsson's The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo and Vikram Chanda's Mumbai-based Sacred Games.

A Dream House,['Carol Chernega'],"How often have you strolled through the villages of Sense and Sensibility, climbed the windswept moors of Wuthering Heights, or raced down dangerous alleys in Oliver Twist's London? These classics are memorable because their authors used their own homes and surroundings to create them. A Dream House takes you on a journey to the homes of sixteen English writers. Each chapter includes a brief biography of the author (or authors) that lived in that home, how the home or countryside was used in various books, what you'll find when you tour the house, and travel directions.

Allusion in Detective Fiction,['Jem Bloomfield'],"This study argues that allusion is a central part of classic British detective fiction. It demonstrates the fraught status of Shakespeare and the Bible during the Golden Age of the British detective novel, and the cultural currents which novelists navigated whilst alluding to them. The first part traces the complex web of allusions to Shakespeare and the Bible which appear in the novels of Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, examining the meanings these allusions produce. The second part explores the way in which Sayers’ own collection of detective novels became a canon, on which later novelists exercised those same allusive practices. It studies allusions to Sayers’ novels throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, from Gladys Mitchell and P.D. James to Reginald Hill and Sujata Massey. This study reveals allusion as a shaping force at the origin of the classic British detective novel, and a continuing element in its identity.",['Literary Criticism']
Watching the Cops,"['Marcus K. Harmes', 'Barbara Harmes', 'Meredith A. Harmes']","Globally, police officers are the object of unprecedented visual scrutiny. The use of mobile phones, CCTV and personal body cams means that police are not only being filmed on the job but are also filming themselves. In popular culture, police have featured heavily on the big screen since the era of silent shorts and on television since the 1930s. Their fictional portrayals today take on added significance in light of social unrest surrounding cases of police brutality and discrimination. These essays explore 21st century portrayals of police on film and television. Chapters often emphasize the Black Lives Matter movement and consider the tone, quality, appropriateness and intention of film and television featuring police activity. Extensively covered works include Mindhunter, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Cops, Criminal Minds and RoboCop, and among the major topics addressed are policing communities, hunting serial killers, police animals, and police in historic settings ranging from the 19th century through the present day and into science fiction futures.",['Performing Arts']

Proceedings of the 2023 2nd International Conference on Social Sciences and Humanities and Arts (SSHA 2023),"['Mohd Fauzi bin Sedon', 'Intakhab Alam Khan', 'Mehmet CÜNEYT BİRKÖK', 'KinSun Chan']","This is an open access book. With the progress of social civilization, social science and its research are becoming more and more important. Theoretically and practically, the study of social phenomena and social problems and the development of prosperous social sciences are the eternal themes of human beings. At present, social science research and its results can hardly meet the needs of social development, especially the unscientific evaluation of social science results, which has aroused great concern from all walks of life, and has produced dirt and questions on social science, thus affecting the proper development of social science. Max Weber once said that ""the most important function of social science in modern times is to keep people ""clear-headed"" and to resist the delusions of ""prophetic legislators"". "" Humanities and arts are the process of perceiving, realizing, thinking, manipulating, and expressing objective or subjective objects through capturing and excavating, feeling and analyzing, integrating and applying, or displaying the stage results in the form obtained through feeling (seeing, hearing, smelling, touching). The social sciences and humanities and arts contain content that will directly affect our lives and the way society functions. And by reacting to today's increasingly intricate problems and situations through systematic and professional discussions, they will further contribute to the improvement of institutions and the development of society. By thinking about issues and looking at problems and the world from different perspectives by putting the two together, it may be possible to have more comprehensive, appropriate, and better responses; for example, the development of laws requires a deeper understanding of the environment in which they are implemented; international trade requires a certain understanding of the customs of different countries; and the development of tax and economic policies requires a certain understanding of the population, consumer demand, etc.",['Social Science']

Deadlier Than The Male,['Jessica Mann'],"Why are English women so good at murder? Among the books which have survived for more than half a century, always in print and always in demand, are the murder mysteries by Dorothy L. Sayers, Agatha Christie and other women writers. Yet their male competitors are mostly forgotten. What is it about these womens' work that has kept it alive? And what was it about the authors that gave them such violent or cunning imaginations, always hidden behind the most respectable of facades? In this book, first published in 1981, Jessica Mann brings the perception of a fellow crime writer to her investigation of her predecessors' lives and work. She discusses the changes in the mystery form over the years, and its enduring worldwide popularity, in a book that was described by one critic as ""e;obligatory reading for any reader of crime fiction""e;, and of which another wrote ""e;I cannot recall a better work of criticism devoted to the crime story.""e;",['Fiction']

Englisch Mit Agatha Christie. Poirot. Das Geheimnisvolle Verbrechen Bei STYLES,['Agatha Christie'],"Sehr geehrte Leser!Ich biete Ihnen eine neue und sehr praktische Art des Lesens zweisprachiger Bücher an, dessen Vorteile Sie überzeugen werden, wenn Sie die Beispielblätter aus diesem Buch im Vorschaufenster durchsehen. Die zweisprachigen Bücher, die nach Methode von Eugene Suchanek bearbeiten wurden, kann man ganz einfach auf einem E-Book-Reader, Smartphone oder Tablet lesen. Die Sätze aus dem Originaltext und die Übersetzung stehen nacheinander und befinden sich nicht in Spalten, was erlaubt, die Schriftgröße kleiner zu machen, damit der ganze Text auf den Bildschirm passt. Außerdem ist der Text der Übersetzung mit einer für die Augen angenehmen grünen Farbe beleuchtet, damit sich das Gehirn zwischen dem Originaltext und der Übersetzung leicht umstellen kann. Die Wahl der Bücher, die nach der Methode von Eugene Suchanek adaptiert wurden, ist für die Nutzer der Geräte mit einem kleinen Bildschirm klar, der Text wird sich dem Gerät anpassen. Sie werden nicht für einen einzigen Moment von anregenden Ereignissen im Buch auf der Suche nach der Übersetzung abkommen. Nach einigen Absätzen gibt es die Wiederholung des Textes ohne deutsche Einfügungen, damit Sie diesen Textabschnitt ohne Übersetzung lesen können, um den Stoff besser zu beherrschen. Die mit der grünen Farbe beleuchtete Übersetzung ist wie ein Rettungsring für den Schwimmen Lernenden, der sich an ihm am Anfang des Erlernens sehr fest hält, aber dann, wenn er sich immer sicherer im Sprachfluss fühlt, lässt er ihn allmählich los und schwimmt selbst, er liest dann nur noch den Originaltext und guckt sehr selten in die Übersetzung. Und danach, wenn alles verständlich ist, kann er lesen, ohne den mit der grünen Farbe beleuchteten Text zu ,,bemerken"". Für maximalen Komfort beim Sprachenlernen mit dieser Methode wird empfohlen, Geräte mit Farbbildschirm zu verwenden. Wie kann man eine Fremdsprache lernen? Gibt es eine andere Methode, als sich mit dem Einpauken der Bücher abzumartern oder im Auditorium zu sitzen und sich zu langweilen? Vielleicht muss man von der Natur lernen und erkennen, ob es eine andere natürliche Methode zum Sprachenlernen gibt? Und doch gibt es eine solche Methode. Wir beneiden oft die Menschen, die eine Fremdsprache erlernt haben, als sie im Heimatland der Muttersprachler waren. Und wirklich, man hört immer wieder die gleichen Wörter, die in verschiedenen Situationen wiederholt werden. Und auf diese Weise, ohne das zu bemerken, beginnt man, in einigen Monaten genug zu verstehen, worüber die Leute im Umfeld sprechen, ohne sich Mühe geben zu müssen. Die Wissenschaftler haben noch keinen Fall festgestellt, wo jemand die Sprache des Landes, in dem er sich befand, nicht lernen konnte. Alle fingen an zu sprechen. Oder zum Beispiel das Kind, das ständig die Eltern reden hört. Viele Menschen, die über viele Jahre eine Fremdsprache erlernten, können die Sprachkenntnisse des 5-, 6-jährigen Kindes beneiden. Aber das Kind strengte sich noch nicht einmal an, um die Sprache zu lernen. Warum haben wir, die Erwachsenen, diese wunderbare Methode vergessen?

Stephen King in the New Millennium,['Despoina N. Feleki'],"This exciting exploration of Stephen King’s digital writing maneuvers and electronic ventures on online platforms and e-readers unravels the author’s latest writing techniques and justifies his unprecedented success in the new millennium. It investigates the latest additions to the Master of Horror’s “toolbox” by studying King’s media presence and writing oeuvre in the twenty-first century through online projects, such as his videogame Discordia. The book closely traces King’s shifts from print to the digital as he crafts his stories to share with his constant readers. Its examination of King’s re-vitalized Gothic sheds light on his shift towards new realizations that take into consideration the needs and tastes of the contemporary consuming public in a constant dialogue with their contemporary fears and anxieties. While exploring King’s literary generic and technological crossovers, the book stresses the need for an encompassing theory that takes into account literary tradition, norms, and motifs adjusted according to the materialities and technological specificities of each medium in specific socio-cultural and economic contexts.",['Social Science']
A Brief Guide to Stephen King,['Paul Simpson'],"2014 marks the 40th anniversary of the publication of Stephen King’s first novel Carrie in April 1974. Rescued from the rubbish by his wife Tabitha, the novel launched the Maine schoolteacher on a prolific and extraordinarily successful career. His name has become synonymous with horror and suspense through over fifty works, including The Dark Tower, a retelling of Byron’s Childe Harold to the Dark Tower Came. Simpson traces the writer’s life from his difficult childhood – his father went out to the shops and never came back – through his initial books under the pseudonym Richard Bachman to the success of Carrie, Salem’s Lot and The Shining in the 1970s, and beyond. He examines how King’s writing was affected by the accident that nearly killed him in 1999 and how his battles with alcohol and addiction to medication have been reflected in his stories.

Stephen King's Contemporary Classics,"['Philip L. Simpson', 'Patrick McAleer']","Many readers know Stephen King for his early works of horror, from his fiction debut Carrie to his blockbuster novels The Shining, The Stand, and Misery, among others. While he continues to be a best-selling author, King’s more recent fiction has not received the kind of critical attention that his books from the 1970s and 1980s enjoyed. Recent novels like Duma Key and 1/22/63 have been marginalized and, arguably, cast aside as anomalies within the author’s extensive canon. In Stephen King’s Contemporary Classics: Reflections on the Modern Master of Horror, Philip L. Simpson and Patrick McAleer present a collection of essays that analyze, assess, and critique King’s post-1995 compositions. Purposefully side-stepping studies of earlier work, these essays are arranged into three main parts: the first section examines five King novels published between 2009 and 2013, offering genuinely fresh scholarship on King; the second part looks at the development of King’s distinct brand of horror; the third section departs from probing the content of King’s writing and instead focuses on King’s process. By concentrating on King’s most recent writings, this collection offers provocative insights into the author’s work, featuring essays on Dr. Sleep, Duma Key, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Joyland, Under the Dome, and others. As such, Stephen King’s Contemporary Classics will appeal to general fans of the author’s work as well as scholars of Stephen King and modern literature.",['Literary Criticism']

Places where-especially during the dark and rainy days of October and November--things can get downright spooky. Author Sharon Kitchens identifies the locations that serve as the basis for King's fictional towns of Castle Rock, Jerusalem's Lot, Derry, and Haven. Drawing on historical materials and conversations with locals and people who know King, the author sheds light on daily life in places that would become the settings for Carrie, Salem's Lot, The Dead Zone, Cujo , IT , and 11/22/63 .",['Biography & Autobiography']

This book critically examines and contextualizes adaptations of the Night Shift short stories, from big box office features to relatively unknown student films. It illuminates how each film is a uniquely and intricately collaborative endeavor, and charts the development of each adaptation from first option to final cut.

A Dark Night's Dreaming,"['Tony Magistrale', 'Michael A. Morrison']","A Dark Night's Dreaming opens by defining the shape of horror fiction today, illuminating the genre's narrative themes, psychological and social contexts, and historical development. The core of the volume focuses on the lives and major works of the six who have dramatically shaped the genre: William Peter Blatty, Thomas Harris, Stephen King, Anne Rice, Peter Straub, and Whitley Strieber. A final chapter analyzes the complex relationship between horror fiction and its adaptation to film. Looking beyond the tormented maidens, madmen, monsters, and other archetypes of the genre, these critics differentiate contemporary Gothic fiction from that of earlier generations while demonstrating that horror remains one of the most important and consistent strains connecting the diverse elements of the American literary tradition. They comment on the genre's enormous popularity and undeniable influence in American society and scrutinize its changing representations of women, monsters, and gore. The volume concludes with an extensive bibliography of primary and secondary works.",['Fiction']

The American Popular Novel After World War II,['David Willbern'],"Through the perspectives of selected best-selling novels from the end of World War II to the end of the 20th century--including The Catcher in the Rye, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Godfather, Jaws, Beloved, The Silence of the Lambs, and Jurassic Park--this book examines the crucial issues the U.S. was experiencing during those decades. These novels represent the voices of popular conversations, as Americans considered issues of family, class, racism and sexism, feminism, economic ambition, sexual violence, war, law, religion and science. Through the windows of fiction, the book surveys the Cold War and anti-communism, the prefeminist era of the 1950s and the sexual revolution of the 1970s, forms of corporate power in the 1960s and 1980s, the traumatic legacies of slavery and Vietnam, the American fascination with lawyers, cops and criminals, alternate styles of romance in the era of late capitalism, our abiding distrust of science, and our steadfast wonder about the Great Mysteries.",['Literary Criticism']

"Exploring the Macabre, Malevolent, and Mysterious","['Matthew Hodge', 'Elizabeth Kusko']","In this unique volume, a number of scholars spanning diverse areas and backgrounds offer fresh insight into how perceived concepts of horror and dark subject matter influence cultures and societies around the world. The contributions here explore how topics considered disturbing, mysterious, or fascinating are found not only in works of fiction and entertainment, but also in the cultural fabrics, belief systems, artistic creations, and even governmental structures of societies.

Thus, this volume of intriguing and profound topics offers scholars, students, and lovers of learning a much-needed fresh and innovative intellectual exploration of the horror genre and the cultural fascination with the mysterious unknown.",['Social Science']

Humanity's Strings,['Ritwick Bhattacharjee'],"Humanity's Strings: Being, Pessimism, and Fantasy interrogates the nature of reality against fantasy as the two are presented to and created by the human consciousness-a consciousness that is in constant struggle with the omnipresence of misery and the inevitability of death. The book shows that being, pessimism, and fantasy as the strings which are made up of forces unseen, unknown, and ungoverned that control the human being like a puppet. Through a study of the metaphysical and existential philosophies of thinkers, such as Franz Brentano, Edmund Husserl, Søren Kierkegaard, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Jacques Derrida, the book interrogates not only how the self interacts with fantasy but why it does as well. It also asks why fantasy forces the self towards a unity that impacts existence in the modern world with its questions of justice, politics, and materiality. Furthermore, it situates the fantasy novels of authors, such as Stephen King, Brandon Sanderson, Douglas Adams, and Robert Jordan, as discourses which delineate the considerations above as ideas which modulate the existence of the human. Additionally, the book shows how it is not just the human that is affected by the machinations of the cosmos but also time and space-ostensibly a priori entities of existence-as these two interact with the human and its consciousness.",['Literary Criticism']

"Religion, Culture, and the Monstrous","['Joseph P. Laycock', 'Natasha L. Mikles']","Religion, Culture, and the Monstrous: Of Gods and Monsters explores the intersection of the emerging field of “monster theory” within religious studies. With case studies from ancient Mesopotamia to contemporary valleys of the Himalayas to ghost tours in Savannah, Georgia, the volume examines the variegated nature of the monstrous as well as the cultural functions of monsters in shaping how we see the world and ourselves. In this, the authors constructively assess the state of the two fields of monster theory and religious studies, and propose new directions in how these fields can inform each other. The case studies included illuminate the ways in which monsters reinforce the categories through which a given culture sees the world. At the same time, the volume points to how monsters appear to question, disrupt, or challenge those categories, creating an ‘unsettling’ or surplus of meaning.",['Religion']
That Is All,['John Hodgman'],"John Hodgman—bestselling author, The Daily Show's ""Resident Expert,"" minor television celebrity, and deranged millionaire—brings us the third and final installment in his trilogy of Complete World Knowledge. In 2005, Dutton published The Areas of My Expertise, a handy little book of Complete World Knowledge, marked by the distinction that all of the fascinating trivia and amazing true facts were completely made up by its author, John Hodgman. At the time, Hodgman was merely a former literary agent and occasional scribbler of fake trivia. In short: a nobody. But during an interview on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, an incredible transformation occurred. He became a famous minor television personality. You may ask: During his whirlwind tornado ride through the high ether of minor fame and outrageous fortune, did John Hodgman forget how to write books of fake trivia? The answer is: Yes. Briefly. But soon, he remembered! And so he returned, crashing his Kansas farmhouse down upon the wicked witch of ignorance with More Information Than You Require, a New York Times bestseller containing even more mesmerizing and essential fake trivia, including seven hundred mole-man names (and their occupations). And now, John Hodgman completes his vision with That Is All, the last book in a trilogy of Complete World Knowledge. Like its predecessors, That Is All compiles incredibly handy made-up facts into brief articles, overlong lists, and beguiling narratives on new and familiar themes. It picks up exactly where More Information left off—specifically, at page 596—and finally completes COMPLETE WORLD KNOWLEDGE. Look out for John Hodgman's latest book, Vacationland, available from Viking in Fall 2017.",['Humor']
IT Chapters One and Two,['Alissa Burger'],"Drawing on critical analysis of film, the horror genre, the Gothic, and Stephen King scholarship, this book considers Andy Muschietti’s IT Chapter One (2017) and IT Chapter Two (2019) on multiple levels: as film (both as individual films and through their interconnected narrative), as adaptation, and as a barometer of the horror film’s popularity among fans. Key points of consideration include the significance of the fictional town of Derry as a traditionally Gothic “bad place,” the role of 1980s nostalgia in these two films, the complex navigation of memory and trauma, gender representation, queer representation, and the return of the repressed. The terrifying figure of Pennywise the clown is central to this analysis, including consideration of performance, costuming, and significance within the larger landscape of the “scary clown” popular culture trope, and through comparison to Tim Curry’s iconic performance in Tommy Lee Wallace’s 1990 miniseries. This Devil's Advocate contextualizes Muschietti’s films within the larger landscape of King’s literary and popular culture influence, as well as the debate surrounding “elevated” horror and the “horror boom” of the late 2010s.",['Performing Arts']
Undead in the West II,"['Cynthia J. Miller', 'A. Bowdoin Van Riper']","The undead are back! In Undead in the West: Vampires, Zombies, Mummies, and Ghosts on the Cinematic Frontier, Cynthia J.

In this new volume, Undead in the West II: They Just Keep Coming, Miller and Van Riper expand their examination of undead Westerns to include not only film, but literature, sequential art, gaming, and fan culture (fan fiction, blogging, fan editing, and zombie walks). These essays run the gamut from comics and graphic novels such as American Vampire, Preacher, and Priest, and games like Darkwatch and Red Dead Redemption, to novels and short stories by celebrated writers including Robert E. Howard, Joe R. Lansdale, and Stephen King. Featuring a foreword by renowned science fiction author William F.

Stanley Kubrick,['Gary D. Rhodes'],"Seventeen essays examine the career and films of director Stanley Kubrick from a variety of perspectives. Part I focuses on his early career, including his first newsreels, his photography for Look magazine, and his earliest films (Fear and Desire, Killer's Kiss). Part II examines his major or most popular films (Paths of Glory, The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey). Part III provides a thorough case study of Eyes Wide Shut, with four very different essays focusing on the film's use of sound, its representation of gender, its carnivalesque qualities, and its phenomenological nature.

Horror Films FAQ,['John Kenneth Muir'],"(FAQ). Horror Films FAQ explores a century of ghoulish and grand horror cinema, gazing at the different characters, situations, settings, and themes featured in the horror film, from final girls, monstrous bogeymen, giant monsters and vampires to the recent torture porn and found footage formats. The book remembers the J-Horror remake trend of the 2000s, and examines the oft-repeated slasher format popularized by John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th (1980). After an introduction positioning the horror film as an important and moral voice in the national dialogue, the book explores the history of horror decade by decade, remembering the women's liberation horrors of the 1970s, the rubber reality films of the late 1980s, the serial killers of the 1990s, and the xenophobic terrors of the 9/11 age. Horror Films FAQ also asks what it means when animals attack in such films as The Birds (1963) or Jaws (1975), and considers the moral underpinnings of rape-and-revenge movies, such as I Spit on Your Grave (1978) and Irreversible (2002).

Gothic Afterlives,['Lorna Piatti-Farnell'],"Gothic Afterlives examines the intersecting dimensions of contemporary Gothic horror and remakes scholarship, bringing together innovative perspectives from different areas of study. The research compiled in this collection covers a wide range of examples, including not only literature but also film, television, video games, and digital media remakes. Gothic Afterlives signals the cultural and conceptual impact of Gothic horror on transmedia production, with a focus on reimagining and remaking. While diverse in content and approach, all chapters pivot on two important points: first, they reflect some of the core preoccupations of Gothic horror by subverting cultural and social certainties about notions such as the body, technology, consumption, human nature, digitalization, scientific experimentation, national identity, memory, and gender and by challenging the boundaries between human and inhuman, self and Other, and good and evil. Second, and perhaps most important, all chapters in the collection collectively show what happens when well-known Gothic horror narratives are adapted and remade into different contexts, highlighting the implications of the mode-shifting registers, platforms, and chronologies in the process. As a collection, Gothic Afterlives hones in on contemporary sociocultural experiences and identities as they appear in contemporary popular culture and in the stories told and retold in the twenty-first century.",['Literary Criticism']
"American Literature in Transition, 1980–1990",['D. Quentin Miller'],"History has not been kind to the 1980s. The decade is often associated with absurd fashion choices, neo-Conservatism in the Reagan/Bush years, the AIDS crisis, Wall Street ethics, and uninspired television, film, and music. Yet the literature of the 1980s is undeniably rich and lasting. American Literature in Transition, 1980–1990 seeks to frame some of the decade's greatest achievements such as Toni Morrison's monumental novel Beloved and to consider some of the trends that began in the 1980s and developed thereafter, including the origins of the graphic novel, prison literature, and the opening of multiculturalism vis-à-vis the 'canon wars'. This volume argues not only for the importance of 1980s American literature, but also for its centrality in understanding trends and trajectories in all contemporary literature against the broader background of culture. This volume serves as both an introduction and a deep consideration of the literary culture of our most maligned decade.",['Literary Criticism']

The Gothic King - Stephen King und die Tradition der Schauerliteratur,['Thorsten Wilms'],"Magisterarbeit aus dem Jahr 2003 im Fachbereich Amerikanistik - Literatur, Note: 1,00, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf (Philosophische Fakultät), Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Diese Arbeit geht der Frage nach, in wie weit der populäre Gattungsbegriff ""Horror"", mit dem Stephen King allgemein identifiziert wird, ausreicht, um seine Werke zu beschreiben. Ist King nicht viel eher ein Repräsentant der ""Gothic Fiction"" bzw. des geographisch einschränkenden Begriffs ""American Gothic Fiction"", welches in erster Linie Elemente der ""Novels of Terror"" und seltener der ""Novels of Horror"" aufgreift? Die Arbeit ist in zwei Teile gegliedert, welche sich von einem umfassenden Überblick, bis hin zu einer detaillierten Analyse einzelner Stilmittel, dem Autor und seinen Werken nähern. Der erste Teil schafft eine Übersicht und eine wissenschaftliche Basis über das Genre Gothic Fiction und die stattfindenden Weiterentwicklungen von Gothic Fiction in Amerika. Dass die politischen und gesellschaftlichen Situationen der jeweiligen Zeit einen großen Einfluss speziell auf Gothic Fiction hatten und haben, verdeutlicht die Betrachtung der American Gothic. Die Entwicklung des Gothic Genres in der Moderne wird ebenfalls im ersten Teil der Arbeit beleuchtet. Der zweite Teil dieser Arbeit befasst sich mit dem Autor Stephen King und seinen Texten. Hier erfolgt die Anwendung der im ersten Teil definierten Kategorien. Zur Einordnung von Kings Werken und zur Herausarbeitung der Gothic Tradition geht Wilms auf die Entwicklung und die Person des Autors ein und analysiere die politische und gesellschaftliche Situation der 70er Jahre. Hier wird deutlich, dass King sich seiner literarischen Vorgänger durchaus bewusst ist und die Konventionen der Gothic Fiction, speziell der American Gothic Fiction nutzt, um seine Romane auf zwei Ebenen wirken zu lassen: Als Erzählungen, die ""excessive emotions"" im Leser generieren, und als Artikulation der Schattenseiten Amerikas und seiner Geschichte.

Mit ""Die Arena"" legt Stephen King ein faszinierendes neues Monumentalwerk vor – seinen umfangreichsten und fesselndsten Roman seit ""The Stand – Das letzte Gefecht"". Urplötzlich stülpt sich eines Tages wie eine unsichtbare Kuppel ein undurchdringliches Kraftfeld über Chester’s Mill. Die Einwohner der neuenglischen Kleinstadt sind komplett von ihrer Umwelt abgeschnitten. Und auf einmal gilt kein herkömmliches Gesetz mehr ... An einem ganz normalen schönen Herbsttag wird die Stadt Chester’s Mill plötzlich auf unerklärliche Weise durch ein unsichtbares Kraftfeld vom Rest der Welt abgeriegelt. Flugzeuge zerschellen daran und fallen als brennende Trümmer vom Himmel, einem Gärtner wird beim Herabsausen ""der Kuppel"" die Hand abgehauen, Tiere werden zweigeteilt, Menschen, die gerade in Nachbarorten unterwegs sind, werden von ihren Familien getrennt, und Autos explodieren, wenn sie auf die mysteriöse Barriere prallen. Es ist allen ein Rätsel, worum es sich bei dieser unsichtbaren Wand handelt, wo sie herkommt und wann – falls überhaupt – sie wieder verschwindet. Es gibt kein Entrinnen – und je mehr die Vorräte zur Neige gehen, desto stärker tobt der bestialische Kampf ums Überleben in dieser unerwünschten Arena ...",['Fiction']

Presenting Young Adult Horror Fiction,['Cosette N. Kies'],"Horror, an increasingly popular subject for books, television, and movies, is especially appealing to teenagers who are enthusiastic fans of ghouls and gore. The appeal of horror literature to young adults cannot be denied or ignored, and in Presenting Young Adult Horror Fiction, the first genre study in the Twayne Young Adult Authors Series, Cosette Kies concentrates on teenage interest in the field. Dr. Kies reminds us that the supernatural has a long literary tradition, including such works as Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, Henry James's The Turn of the Screw, and Edgar Allan Poe's short stories. Against this literary background, Dr. Kies takes a witty and perceptive look at contemporary manifestations of horror fiction, highlighting those authors that teenagers particularly enjoy. Writers such as V.C. Andrews, Dean Koontz, John Saul, Anne Rice, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, Robert Bloch, Robert MacCammon, and, of course, Stephen King are examined in depth. Each chapter includes an introduction that touches on historical antecedents, a chronology of biographical highlights and major works for the subject author, and a long quote that allows the writer's individual voice to shed light on his or her literary philosophy. Dr. Kies analyzes theme, plot, and character for the major works with perception and skill. Separate chapters explore the appeal of satanism for young adults in novels such as The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby, and there is an irreverent look at a recent development in horror writing--splatterpunk. Presenting Young Adult Horror Fiction is a welcome addition for all those interested in horror literature and will also provide much-needed information for librarians, teachers, and parents who want to understand why young adults love horror literature.",['American fiction']

Grand Illusion,"['Wayne Barrett', 'Dan Collins']","Rudy Giuliani emerged from the smoke of 9/11 as the unquestioned hero of the day: America's Mayor, the father figure we could all rely on to be tough, to be wise, to do the right thing. In that uncertain time, it was a comfort to know that he was on the scene and in control, making the best of a dire situation. But was he really? Grand Illusion is the definitive report on Rudy Giuliani's role in 9/11—the true story of what happened that day and the first clear-eyed evaluation of Giuliani's role before, during, and after the disaster. While the pictures of a soot-covered Giuliani making his way through the streets became very much a part of his personal mythology, they were also a symbol of one of his greatest failures. The mayor's performance, though marked by personal courage and grace under fire, followed two terms in office pursuing an utterly wrongheaded approach to the city's security against terrorism. Turning the mythology on its head, Grand Illusion reveals how Giuliani has revised his own history, casting himself as prescient terror hawk when in fact he ran his administration as if terrorist threats simply did not exist, too distracted by pet projects and turf wars to attend to vital precautions. Authors Wayne Barrett and Dan Collins also provide the first authoritative view of the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, recounting the triumphs and missteps of the city's efforts to heal itself. With surprising new reporting about the victims, the villains, and the heroes, this is an eye-opening reassessment of one of the pivotal events—and politicians—of our time.",['History']

Drawing on the Bible, the Fathers of the Church, classical writers like Cicero, and medieval historians such as the Venerable Bede and Symeon of Durham, he insisted on the importance of history for guiding human action, declaring that the meaning of the past can only be known in the present and that only at the end can one understand the beginning. In this volume are four of Aelred's seven historical works: Lament for David, King of Scots (written 1153), The Genealogy of the Kings of the English (1153-1154), The Life of Saint Edward, King and Confessor (1162-63), and the Battle of the Standard (?1153-54).",['Biography & Autobiography']

"Eleanor of Aquitaine, Courtly Love, and the Troubadours",['Ffiona Swabey'],"The author offers an accessible overview of the vibrant personal and intellectual developments in the medieval court and monasteries during Eleanor of Aquitaine's lifetime. Primary documents, biographical material and thematic chapters bring this unique period to life. Eleanor of Aquitaine lived in a remarkable age. The 12th century saw significant advances in both the intellectual and emotional spheres. Scholars explored new areas of philosophy and science and also began to reflect on relationships and what it meant to be human and an individual. For the troubadours and the writers of the new romances, who composed in vernacular language, the focus of their works was the expression of personal feelings and the image of the feminine. Women had had more significant parts to play in the first millennium than in the second, because with the militarization of Europe and the emergence of universities, from which women were excluded, they lost much of their influence. This created an imbalance in society and it is within this context that Eleanor's life should be reviewed. The period is sometimes called the Twelfth Century Awakening due to the outpouring of extraordinary intellectual inquiry and discovery. Cathedral schools and universities, Islamic influence on European thought, the classical revival, vernacular literature, and Gothic architecture all exerted powerful pulls on the era's culture and politics. Accounts of Eleanor of Aquitaine's life provides a rare glimpse into women's lives during the medieval period, and though an admittedly extraordinary figure, we are able to draw some general conclusions about marriage and motherhood. Troubadours and courtly love, which revolved around declarations of service, devotion, and passion, and an emerging sense of the self. Thematic chapters hit the major topics, laying them out in clear and easy-to-follow writing. Nineteen biographical sketches bring to life the topics, and 15 primary documents, including songs, letters, and poems provide a close-up glimpse of how the people of the time saw their own world. Genealogical tables, maps, chronology, and a timeline provide useful and information quickly. The book concludes with an annotated bibliography and an index.",['Biography & Autobiography']
"Nightmares in Red, White and Blue",['Joseph Maddrey'],"What's weighing on Americans? Look to horror movies for your answer--they're one of the best measures of the American consciousness. From an early fascination with the Gothic, to the mutant horrors of the Atomic Age and alien enemies of the Cold War, to the inner demons of the psyche and the American Dream turned nightmare, the history of American horror films is a reflection of changing American cultural attitudes and values--and the fears that accompany them. This survey of the pivotal horror films produced in America examines the history of the genre as a reflection of cultural changes in the United States. It begins with an exploration of the origins of the genre, and follows its development until the present, using various films to document the evolution of Hollywood horror flicks and illustrate their cultural significance. The second part focuses on eight pivotal directors whose personal visions helped shape the genre--from early pioneers like Tod Browning and Alfred Hitchcock, to modern masters like John Carpenter and Wes Craven.

Der Ickabog,['J.K. Rowling'],"Der Ickabog kommt ... Ein sagenumwobenes Ungeheuer, ein Königreich in großer Gefahr und zwei Kinder, die außergewöhnlichen Mut beweisen müssen. In diesem ganz besonderen Märchen geht es um den Sieg von Hoffnung und Freundschaft gegen alle Widrigkeiten, erdacht von einer der besten Geschichtenerzählerinnen der Welt, J.K. Rowling. Schlaraffien war einst das glücklichste Königreich der Welt. Es gab Gold zuhauf, einen König mit einem unglaublich schneidigen Schnurrbart und dazu Metzger, Bäcker und Käser, die mit den erlesenen Produkten ihrer Handwerkskunst Menschen vor Begeisterung zum Tanzen brachten, wenn sie davon aßen. Alles war perfekt – wenn man einmal vom nebligen Marschland im Norden absieht, wo einer Legende nach der schreckliche Ickabog haust. Natürlich weiß jeder, dass der Ickabog nur ein Mythos ist, mit dem man kleinen Kindern Angst macht. Das Lustige an solchen Geschichten ist aber, dass sie manchmal ein eigenes Leben entwickeln. Kann ein Mythos zur Absetzung eines beliebten Königs führen? Kann er ein Land an den Rand des Verderbens bringen? Und kann er zwei Kinder völlig unerwartet in ein gefährliches Abenteuer stürzen?

The Creative Curve,['Allen Gannett'],"A great idea isn't a sudden light-bulb moment. It's taking something familiar and making it feel new. We’ve been told a lie about the nature of creativity. We're told stories about creative geniuses – the young Mozart who effortlessly overshadows the hardworking Salieri; Paul McCartney coming up with the tune for Yesterday in a dream one morning; JK Rowling finding inspiration for Harry Potter sitting on a train to London. What we aren’t told is the actual story behind such hits. In fact there is a science and method for mainstream success, whether writing a popular novel, starting a company or creating an effective marketing campaign, and in this book Allen Gannett – data wizard and successful entrepreneur – reveals the four laws of creativity that are proven to work. New ideas are surprising at first, and slowly become familiar as we get used to them. Allan Gannett reveals there’s a sweet spot between what feels familiar and safe to us, and what is innovative and new: the point of optimal tension between safety and surprise, similarity and difference. The people we think of as creative geniuses are people who understand this sweet spot instinctively; they know what people find familiar and reassuring, and they find ways to reinvent it fresh. Packed with stories and insights ranging from the team behind Dear Evan Hansen to the founder of Reddit, from the Chief Content Officer of Netflix to Michelin starred chefs, The Creative Curve will help you spend less time on ideas destined to fail and more time on ideas that really break out. This book is for everyone, whether you’re a business leader, a creative artist or a budding entrepreneur – and will teach you the secret to conceiving great ideas that can achieve major success.",['Business & Economics']
Potter Stinks,['Keridiana Chez'],"Decades after captivating the globe with the Harry Potter series, J. K. Rowling ignited fierce controversy by promoting anti-trans views through social media and her website. The ensuing debate prompted a re-reckoning of the series’s latent conservatism as devoted fans grappled with its lionized author’s online vitriol against a vulnerable group. In the wake of this controversy, Potter Stinks: Gender and Species in J. K. Rowling’s ""Harry Potter"" Series critically examines the limitations of the liberalism embedded within the series. At the same time, the book highlights what remains worthy of celebration and rekindles important conversations about the intersection of literature, ideology, and social change. Looking primarily at the original seven books, author Keridiana Chez discusses how gender and species discourses operate in wizarding society, intersecting with questions of class, technology, and labor as well as gender and species fluidity and trans identities. Potter Stinks serves as a vital contribution to Harry Potter scholarship, paving the way for a more nuanced understanding of one of the most influential literary franchises of our time.",['Literary Criticism']
Harry Potter - Betrachtung eines literarischen Phänomens und Analysen zu den erfahrungsdokumentierten Dimensionen zur pädagogischen Relevanz dieses Bestsellers,['Sam Körber'],"Examensarbeit aus dem Jahr 2003 im Fachbereich Pädagogik - Schulpädagogik, Note: 1, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: „Er wird berühmt werden - eine Legende - [...] ganze Bücher wird man über Harry schreiben - jedes Kind auf der Welt wird seinen Namen kennen“. Wie schnell sich die Prognose von Prof. McGonagall, der Lehrerin für Verwandlung aus dem Buch „Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen“ von der Autorin J.K. Rowling, bereits nach Erscheinen des ersten Bandes in eine kaum noch überschaubare Realität verwandelt hat, setzt sogar große Kenner der Kinder- und Jugendliteratur in Staunen. „Harry Potter“, ein Phänomen zwischen märchenhafter Imagination und verträumter Wirklichkeit, ist aber auch bei Erwachsenen aller Kontinente zum Begriff geworden. Er und seine Freunde, stets im nach Gerechtigkeit suchenden Kampf gegen das Böse aktiv, eroberten bisher Sinn und Gemüt von Jung und Alt. Selbst süffisante Rezensoren einschlägiger Literatur, ob kirchlich oder weltlich, konnten sich meist ihrer Begeisterung nicht enthalten, was sich in Windeseile auf viele Millionen Menschen übertrug. Die überraschende Wirksamkeit Harry Potters liegt wohl in dessen verzaubertem, aber gleichzeitig menschlichem Verhalten. Die Leserinnen und Leser identifizieren sich schnell mit ihm und seinen spannenden Aktivitäten und vitalisieren damit ihre Wunschvorstellungen. Der Spuk wird symbolisch in die selbst durchlebte Wirklichkeit übertragen, fantasievoll erscheinen die von dem Zauberlehrling durchgemachten Taten und Erlebnisse als eigene Abenteuer. Die Kinder zaubern mit, steigen aus der oft harten eigenen Umwelt in das Reich von Illusionen und fiebern als große Gemeinschaft von Fans über alle Grenzen hinweg für Harry. Kaum eine andere literarische Figur hat Mädchen und Jungen in den vergangenen Jahren weltweit derart beschäftigt wie Harry. Hexerei und Zauberei gerieten international in aller Munde, wobei sogar die Frage auftauchte, ob die „Pottermania“ eine Zeiterscheinung der Esoterikwelle wiedergibt. Trotz zunächst mäßigen Umsatzes löste die Kinderbuchreihe bereits nach dem Erscheinen des ersten Bandes, welcher Ende 2001 als Realverfilmung in die Kinos kam, in England Beifall aus. In kurzer Zeit wurde das Werk mit mehreren Preisen ausgezeichnet, die Übersetzungswelle rollte an und bei Kindern wie bei Erwachsenen entwickelte sich ein neuer Kult. Durch „Harry Potter“ wurde die junge Autorin zu einer der erfolgreichsten Schriftstellerinnen aller Zeiten.",['Education']
"Understanding ""I""",['José Luis Bermúdez'],"No words in English are shorter than ""I"" and few, if any, play a more fundamental role in language and thought. In Understanding ""I"": Thought and Language José Luis Bermúdez continues his longstanding work on the self and self-consciousness. Bermúdez develops a model of how language-users understand sentences involving the first person pronoun ""I"". This model illuminates the unique psychological role that self-conscious thoughts (typically expressed using ""I"") play in action and thought - a unique role often summarized by describing ""I"" as an essential indexical. The book opens with an argument directly supporting the indispensability of ""I""-thoughts in explaining action. After motivating a broadly Fregean approach linguistic understanding it critically examines Frege's own remarks on ""I"" as well as the Fregean account offered by Gareth Evans. The main part of the book develops an account of the sense of ""I"" that explains a cluster of related phenomena, including essential indexicality, immunity to error through misidentification, the shareability of ""I""-thoughts, the relation between ""I"" and ""you"", and the role of autobiographical memory in self-consciousness.",['Philosophy']
A Tale of Two Villains,['Calvin H. Cherry'],"Prepare to be delightfully surprised to discover that the godfather of all vampires and the infamous dark wizard share a deep character bond that goes far beyond the title 'monster.' Be intrigued to uncover what a coffin and a horcrux share or to dig further to unearth that the often-overlooked scars which Bram Stoker wrote of in Victorian England are just as significant as those described by J. K. Rowling in the modern era. Indeed, it cannot be a mere coincidence that Dracula was hurt in 1897 and 100 years later, Harry is too. Bookshelves and databases are full of fascinating sources celebrating the supernatural worlds created by beloved authors Bram Stoker and J.K. Rowling. The millions of fans of Dracula and Harry Potter consist of all age groups and varied enthusiasm, ranging from a curious reader or leisure cinema observer to seriously devoted academic scholars. However, followers of each universe have been chiefly segregated – rarely mingling apart from an occasional culture convention, widely dominated by Star Wars, Star Trek, and Marvel heroes' groupies. This is most unfortunate because Stoker and Rowling readers have a lot in common. This is because Count Dracula and Lord Voldemort have much in common. In fact, these two internationally acclaimed bestselling novels possess a remarkable kinship. A Tale of Two Villains is a love letter to both sets of fans paying homage to two superb authors and their extraordinary respective works. It is the first text to set both masterpieces on pedestals, side by side, analyzing the words on the page and the thoughts behind them - exploring their similar themes, unique parallelism, and mystical symbolism. The author delves profoundly into the interesting characters, their traits, conflicts, and motivations, to show how literary art is born. This book is a must have for any Stoker or Rowling reader, as it is the first of its kind ever published.",['Literary Criticism']

Harry Potter and Resistance,['Beth Sutton-Ramspeck'],"Although rule breaking in Harry Potter is sometimes dismissed as a distraction from Harry’s fight against Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter and Resistance makes the case that it is central to the battle against evil. Far beyond youthful hijinks or adolescent defiance, Harry’s rebellion aims to overcome problems deeper and more widespread than a single malevolent wizard. Harry and his allies engage in a resistance movement against the corruption of the Ministry of Magic as well as against the racist social norms that gave rise to Voldemort in the first place. Dumbledore’s Army and the Order of the Phoenix employ methods echoing those utilized by World War II resistance fighters and by the U.S. Civil Rights movement. The aim of this book is to explore issues that speak to our era of heightened political awareness and resistance to intolerance. Its interdisciplinary approach draws on political science, psychology, philosophy, history, race studies, and women’s studies, as well as newer interdisciplinary fields such as resistance studies, disgust studies, and creativity studies.",['Literary Criticism']

The Role of Women within the Harry Potter Series,['J. B.'],"Examensarbeit aus dem Jahr 2016 im Fachbereich Anglistik - Literatur, Note: 1,7, Universität Regensburg (Anglistik), Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: In this thesis, the author focuses on the feminist debate around the Harry Potter series. The question whether Harry Potter can be seen as sexist or as feminist will be investigated and analysed while taking a closer look at the characters of Fleur Delacour, Dolores Umbridge and Hermione Granger. [...] Generally speaking, when it comes to the identification of the role of females within the Harry Potter series, critics are notably divided here. According to Anne Collins Smith, there are two different directions of interpreting J.K. Rowling’s work; the ones who see feminism supported and thoroughly depicted in the books and those critics who think of the Harry Potter series as being sexist (cf. Collins Smith 80). The critics who point out the sexism within the Harry Potter series are directed by writers such as Elizabeth Heilman, Trevor Donaldson and Christine Schoefer. Christine Schoefer’s article is titled Harry Potter's Girl Trouble and was published on the release day of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. It focuses on the alleged sexism within the Harry Potter series. She states that J.K. Rowling’s message to the reader of her series is that boys should be the leaders in the world and girls are hardly likeable and thus play the role of the supporters of the male supremacy – at best (cf. Schoefer). Matching Christine Schoefer’s thoughts in many points, Elizabeth E. Heilman and Trevor Donaldson have published their essay From Sexist to (sort-of) Feminist: Representations of Gender in the Harry Potter Series. These publications are strongly based on the idea of the Harry Potter series being a reinforcement of gender stereotypes (cf. Schoefer, cf. Heilman and Donaldson 139). Here, Heilman and Donaldson especially criticise the “absence of powerful females” (cf. Heilman and Donaldson 139). Females always fulfil secondary positions within the books, concerning power and authority, and the Harry Potter series follow typical stereotypes for both males and females (cf. Heilman and Donaldson 139). It is stated that the book series contains far more important male characters: 115 females mentioned in the series are barely more than half as many characters as the 201 males which are included. Also, according to Heilman and Donaldson, the more dominant characters are almost exclusively male. Here, they especially refer to evil characters such as Severus Snape, Draco Malfoy, Wormtail and of course Lord Voldemort (cf. Heilman and Donaldson 141). [...]",['Literary Criticism']

Die Geschichten um den Zauberlehrling sind zweifelsohne zu einem Phänomen geworden, welches sich wohl niemand so richtig erklären kann. „Harry Potter“ wurde in über vierzig Sprachen übersetzt, erreichte Auflagen in absoluten Rekordhöhen und nacheinander besetzten alle vier Bände die Bestsellerlisten. Damit zählt die „Harry Potter“ –Reihe nicht nur zu den erfolgreichsten Kinderund Jugendbüchern, nein, sie zählt zu den erfolgreichsten Büchern überhaupt. Noch nie hat ein Buch, und schon gar nicht ein Kinder- und Jugendbuch, soviel Aufsehen erregt. Noch verwunderlicher erscheint der Erfolg in einer Zeit, in der bereits das Ende der Lesekultur gesehen wurde. Kinder lesen gar nicht oder zu wenig, wird oft geklagt, und Schulbücher werden nur mit großem Murren gelesen. Und nun greifen Millionen von Kindern zu Büchern, welche jeweils beachtliche Seitenzahlen haben, und lesen sie nicht nur, sondern animieren ihre Eltern, ihre Freunde oder andere Verwandte dazu, es auch lesen? Bei einer Erhebung im Stadtgebiet Erfurt wurden insgesamt 1188 Schüler der zweiten, dritten und vierten Klasse, unter anderem zu ihren Lesegewohnheiten, befragt. Auf die Frage nach ihrer Lieblingslektüre gaben 174 Probanden, von denen 26 Schüler der zweiten Klasse waren, das Buch „Harry Potter“ an.1 Dies ist nur ein exemplarisches Beispiel für die große Beliebtheit und die allgemeine Bekanntheit des Buches „Harry Potter“, welches, trotz hunderter Seiten, auch unter sehr jungen Kindern hoch geschätzt ist. Doch wie ist das zu erklären? Der Markt boomt, das Merchandising ist kaum zu übersehen, es gibt vom „Harry-Potter“ – Radiergummi bis zum TShirt alles zu kaufen, der erste Teil ist verfilmt, die Hörbücher haben ebenfalls in die Kinderzimmer gefunden. Harry ist also in aller Munde und scheint überall präsent zu sein. Doch ein ausgefeiltes Merchandisingprogramm kann diesen Erfolg nicht erklären.

Warum ist „Harry Potter“ populär? Wie J.K.

Die bisher erschienenen vier Bände der Autorin Joanne K. Rowling rund um den Zauberer Harry Potter kann man zweifelsohne als Phänomen bezeichnen, als etwas, das ungewöhnlich und auffällig erscheint.2 Doch in diesem Fall sind nicht etwa die Inhalte ungewöhnlich und auffällig, denn es handelt sich hierbei eigentlich um ein relativ „normales“ Kinderbuch, das man in das literarische Feld der fantastischen Kinder- und Jugendliteratur einordnen kann. 3 Als Phänomen ist in diesem Fall vielmehr der weltweit gigantische Erfolg dieser Buchserie zu nennen, denn es gibt wohl kaum ein anderes Kinderbuch, das in mehr als 40 Sprachen übersetzt wurde4, und kaum ein Kind im lesefähigen Alter, das die Bücher nicht „verschlungen“ und sich nicht vom „Potter- Fieber“ hat anstecken lassen. Die Journalistin und Literaturwissenschaftlerin Susanne Gaschke schrieb dazu in der Wochenzeitung Die Zeit: Keine andere literarische Figur hat Kinder auf der ganzen Welt in den vergangenen Jahren mehr beschäftigt als Harry Potter.5 Laut einer Umfrage der Süddeutschen Zeitung ist Harry Potter in Großbritannien tatsächlich bekannter als jede andere literarische Figur, einschließlich Sherlock Holmes, James Bond und Miss Marple.6 -------- 1 Rowling, J.

History and Future of Mass Media,['David Demers'],"This book argues that the no-Marxists mostly have it wrong. Although corporate media are structurally organized to maximize profits and produce content that generally helps elites achieve their goals, this does not mean corporate media have less capacity to facilitate social change than entrepreneurial or other forms of media. In fact, historical evidence and comparative critical studies presented in this book show that mass media become more, not less, critical of dominant power groups, institutions and value systems as they become more ""corporatized.""This proposition is part of a larger theoretical model that integrates the role of both social structure and human agency in explaining the persistence of modern capitalism. The structural part of the theory also enables scholars to make predictions about the future of mass media, including the ideas that the Internet is ""stealing"" some of the mediating power of traditional mass media, and the market power of global media will grow in absolute terms but will shrink in relative terms because of increasing competition from new and traditional media.",['Language Arts & Disciplines']

Rowling, given as a measure of appreciation for the work she does on The Leaky Cauldron, where her job entails being a fan, reporter, guardian, and spokesperson for the Harry Potter series. For ten years, millions of fans have lived inside literary history, the only fans to know what it was like when Harry Potter was unfinished. When anticipation for a book was just as likely to cause a charity drive as a pistol shootout. When millions of rabid fans looked to friends, families, neighbors, forums, discussion groups, fan fiction and podcasts to get their fix between novels. When the death of a character was a hotter bet than who'd win the World Series. When one series of books had the power to change the way books are read. This has been a time when a book was more popular than movies, television, and video games. The series has spawned a generation of critical thinkers and new readers. The New York Times changed the way it reported book sales just to avoid a continual overpowering of its bestseller list. These events must be given their proper context, and this moment must be preserved. The series will remain important to literature and pop culture, but the experience will change. Harry's fate will be as commonly known as the identity of Luke Skywalker's father, and readers who never had to wait for a Harry Potter book will have no idea what transpired when the series had hundreds of millions of people waiting desperately for the next volume. We are the first wave of Harry Potter fans, the ones that are living in the time that shapes how Harry Potter will be remembered for all time. But when this era is over, fans will need some way to remember this strange, wonderful, dizzying experience. Future fans, too, will want to know what they missed. Harry Potter will exist as a seven-book series, but without the indivisible story of the cultural, literary and emotional impact the series has made, the story is incomplete. How can a fan understand Harry Potter without hearing about the midnight book parties, the scams, the theories, the burglaries, the bets, the bannings, and most importantly, the worldwide camaraderie spurred on by mutual love of a boy wizard? How can they know how Harry Potter changed and touched the lives of so many without hearing it first hand? Harry, A History tells this story. It tells the personal story of Melissa Anelli's journey through the very heart of Harry Potter fandom. And wraps this phenomenon up into one narrative, factual volume – one book that tells what happened when Harry Potter met the world.",['Fiction']

"Harry, A History - Now Updated with J.K. Rowling Interview, New Chapter & Photos",['Melissa Anelli'],"A new enhanced e-book edition, featuring an extended transcript from Melissa Anelli's exclusive interview with J. K. Rowling and a new, updated chapter! Melissa Anelli wears a ring that was a gift to her from J.K. Rowling, given as a measure of appreciation for the work she does on The Leaky Cauldron, where her job entails being a fan, reporter, guardian, and spokesperson for the Harry Potter series. For ten years, millions of fans have lived inside literary history, the only fans to know what it was like when Harry Potter was unfinished. When anticipation for a book was just as likely to cause a charity drive as a pistol shootout. When millions of rabid fans looked to friends, families, neighbors, forums, discussion groups, fan fiction and podcasts to get their fix between novels. When the death of a character was a hotter bet than who'd win the World Series. When one series of books had the power to change the way books are read. This has been a time when a book was more popular than movies, television, and video games. The series has spawned a generation of critical thinkers and new readers. The New York Times changed the way it reported book sales just to avoid a continual overpowering of its bestseller list. These events must be given their proper context, and this moment must be preserved. The series will remain important to literature and pop culture, but the experience will change. Harry's fate will be as commonly known as the identity of Luke Skywalker's father, and readers who never had to wait for a Harry Potter book will have no idea what transpired when the series had hundreds of millions of people waiting desperately for the next volume. We are the first wave of Harry Potter fans, the ones that are living in the time that shapes how Harry Potter will be remembered for all time. But when this era is over, fans will need some way to remember this strange, wonderful, dizzying experience. Future fans, too, will want to know what they missed. Harry Potter will exist as a seven-book series, but without the indivisible story of the cultural, literary and emotional impact the series has made, the story is incomplete. How can a fan understand Harry Potter without hearing about the midnight book parties, the scams, the theories, the burglaries, the bets, the bannings, and most importantly, the worldwide camaraderie spurred on by mutual love of a boy wizard? How can they know how Harry Potter changed and touched the lives of so many without hearing it first hand? Harry, A History tells this story. It tells the personal story of Melissa Anelli's journey through the very heart of Harry Potter fandom. And wraps this phenomenon up into one narrative, factual volume – one book that tells what happened when Harry Potter met the world.",['Fiction']

This detailed study of Harry Potter explores the limits of the formulaic structure of adolescent fantasy fiction and also examines the impulse of exploration, subversion, and resistance contained within the formula.

The Alchemical Harry Potter,['Anne J. Mamary'],"When Harry Potter first boards the Hogwarts Express, he journeys to a world which Rowling says has alchemy as its ""internal logic."" The Philosopher's Stone, known for its power to transform base metals into gold and to give immortality to its maker, is the subject of the conflict between Harry and Voldemort in the first book of the series. But alchemy is not about money or eternal life, it is much more about the transformations of desire, of power and of people--through love. Harry's equally remarkable and ordinary power to love leads to his desire to find but not use the Philosopher's Stone at the start of the series and his wish to end the destructive power of the Elder Wand at the end. This collection of essays on alchemical symbolism and transformations in Rowling's series demonstrates how Harry's work with magical objects, people, and creatures transfigure desire, power, and identity. As Harry's leaden existence on Privet Drive is transformed in the company of his friends and teachers, the Harry Potter novels have transformed millions of readers, inspiring us to find the gold in our ordinary lives.",['Literary Criticism']

Harry Potter and the Classical World,['Richard A. Spencer'],"J.K.

""Fluffy,"" the vicious three-headed dog in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, is clearly a repackaging of Cerberus, the hellhound of Greek and Roman mythology. But the significance of Rowling's quotation from Aeschylus at the front of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a matter of speculation. Her use of classical material is often presented with irony and humor. This extensive analysis of the Harry Potter series examines Rowling's wide range of allusion to classical characters and themes and her varied use of classical languages.

Myths and Symbols in J.K. Rowling ́s Harry Potter and the Philosopher ́s Stone,['Volker Geyer'],"Seminar paper from the year 2001 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: very good, University of Erfurt (Anglistics/ American Studies), language: English, abstract: 1. Introduction It’s beyond doubt that J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books are one of the biggest surprise and success in literature history. They influenced the youths’ reading habits in a never known way. What is this great success founded on? This question can’t be answered sweepingly. The reasons are many-sided. In my opinion, an important reason is the combination of the youths’ real world with the fantastic and mystic world. The youths find their real experiences at school, with parents, friends and enemies combined with a realm of witchcraft, symbols superhuman skills and dangerous adventures. But a lot of youths know a big part of the mystic world, too. Subconsciously the old fairy tales and legends are waked up again. And so the fascination from childhood days is swinging in the background while reading Harry Potter. The youth find again well-known symbols and myths, e.g. mystic numbers, ghosts, struggle between good and evil, transformation and invisibility, animals like dragons, owls, rats and mystic places like a dark wood, an old hut, secret passageways etc. But they discover or learn about new aspects of the mystic world by reading Harry Potter, e.g. the wish for never ending life, the philosopher’s stone, desire and craving, meaning of unicorn or the search for wisdom. They get new experiences and see some new aspects of their own life. These delicate net of myths and symbols woven in the books make they very exiting for adults, too. Besides some new ideas, there are a lot of traditional symbols and myths with different origins and meanings. In this paper I am describing only the most important symbols and myths. I am going to explain the general meaning from history and the specific meaning in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. [...]",['Literary Criticism']

Names and Their Underlying Mythology in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter-Novels,['Anne-Christin Hirsch'],"Seminar paper from the year 2008 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 1,3, University of Leipzig (Institut f r Anglistik), course: Harry Potter and The End, 27 entries in the bibliography, language: English, abstract: The Harry Potter series display such a complex set of plots with so many references to history, legend and literature, with so many playfully arranged puns according to the names of characters, creatures, items or places that one cannot easily decide where to begin with an examination that may befit the extent of a seminar paper. The finally chosen scope of this paper refers to my general interest in mythology and legend as well as to Rowling's admiring aptitude to equip her characters from an extraordinary variety of backgrounds. Names are the most obvious means of depicting literary characters and their intended personalities. Yet, considering the multiplicity of those characters in the ever further developed seven novels, further specification appears to be necessary to meet the demands of this paper. Therefore, its focus is limited to character names and in that to several selected characters only, whose names demonstrate mythological background most efficiently. To that effect, I am not exclusively following a selective principle regarding the characters' significance in the books. Surely enough, there are several major characters bearing names grounded on mythology, yet Rowling placed so many according hints and links on minor characters and on figures not even acting in the story(ies) themselves that it would seem a squandering of her labour to concentrate on particular 'significant' characters only. ...]",['Language Arts & Disciplines']

"Gender Stereotypes in J. K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows""",['Su Erden'],"Studienarbeit aus dem Jahr 2020 im Fachbereich Anglistik - Literatur, , Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: The portrayal of women in the Harry Potter series could be considered a highly controversial topic, especially among feminist advocates. Firstly, J. K. Rowling herself has faced discrimination based on the fact that she is a woman, which is why she ultimately was pressured into releasing the Harry Potter series under a pen name. This was done in order to get the support of a publishing company after getting rejected a total of twelve times. Despite this, many argue that she has portrayed some of the most significant characters within the Harry Potter series in stereotypical to even harmful ways. As there are some, who, especially due to Rowling’s public actions, believe women are not portrayed in a favorable or feminist way in the Harry Potter series, it is the aim of this paper to take a closer look at the seventh, and arguably most important, part of the series to determine whether or not specific characters are portrayed in a stereotypical and sexist ways. I will briefly take on the notion of sex and gender, explained by Connel, West and Zimmerman, as well as gender stereotypes and the way gender is portrayed in children’s literature, introduced by Wilma J. Pyle. Furthermore, I will take a look at the seventh book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and briefly put its content into context. Lastly, I will take on specific female characters and explain, how i. e. through specific language and behavior patterns, they are portrayed in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallow. In a separate chapter, I will take a closer look at the female protagonist Hermione Granger to discuss, whether she is presented in a stereotypical, sexist way or not and how the way she is portrayed is recognizable in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.",['Literary Criticism']

In an effort to thwart Grindelwald's plans, Albus Dumbledore enlists Newt, his former Hogwarts student, who agrees to help once again, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world. This second original screenplay from J.K.

Wolf of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the last book in Rowling's acclaimed series, and how he believes she disregarded everything she wrote in her previous novels. For Harry Potter fans, Broken Wand is must-have reading Using the actual texts, the author finds issues with Rowling's continuity. Like the Trace Charm that would have made it impossible for the teenage Voldemort to get away with killing his Muggle relatives. Or the idea of Harry carrying a piece of Voldemort's soul inside him from the start, when the Dark Lord couldn't even touch him for the first four books. Or ""wandlore,"" which has no consistency to it at all. Citing plot elements like: questioning Harry's account of the murder in the previous book, the Ministry taking over Hogwarts, Snape's Pensieve memories, and Dumbledore explaining his mistakes; Broken Wand maintains that Rowling's Deathly Hallows is essentially just a bad copy of the fifth book in the series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Wolf also contends that Dumbledore, Snape, Lily Potter, and Voldemort are completely out of character, and Harry merely repeats the same emotional journey he went through before. Plus, there are many questions and plots left unresolved. About the Author: Timothy A. Wolf spent two years researching and writing Broken Wand.

Rowling’s Harry Potter books, has come to an end, the Harry Potter series can still be seen as the most influential and most popular fantasy novels of our time. Children and adults around the world have read the stories of how the adolescent wizard Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione fight against Lord Voldemort and his followers. Professors of the Anglistik and Amerikanistik, such as Prof. Dr. Kullmann even claim that Harry Potter has the potential to become a classic and can be mentioned in the same breath with Alice in Wonderland or The Hobbit (DieWelt2012). Despite all the praise for the novels, also many critics have reflected about and commented on J.K. Rowling’s novels. In my bachelor thesis I am going to take a more critical look at the Harry Potter series, focusing mainly on Rowling’s fifth novel titled Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which builds the basis of my text oriented analysis. As the title of my bachelor thesis: Aspects of race and parallels with the Third Reich in J.K.

(Zitat auf S. 3 in diesem Buch) Jane Austens Stolz und Vorurteil, erstmals 1813 veröffentlicht, gilt als einer der bekanntesten Liebesromane der Literaturgeschichte. Mit feiner Ironie und messerscharfer Beobachtungsgabe erzählt Austen von den gesellschaftlichen Zwängen und Missverständnissen, die die Beziehung zwischen Elizabeth Bennet und Mr. Darcy prägen. Das Werk begeistert bis heute, weil es universelle Themen wie Liebe, Stolz und die Überwindung von Vorurteilen in einem zeitlosen Rahmen behandelt.

Jahrhunderts entfaltet sich eine zeitlose Geschichte von Leidenschaft, Stolz und Vorurteilen. Elizabeth Bennet, eine lebhafte und intelligente junge Frau, ist die zweite von fünf Schwestern in einer Familie mit bescheidenen Mitteln. Ihr scharfer Verstand und ihr Streben nach Unabhängigkeit zeichnen sie in einer Gesellschaft aus, in der Anstand und Heiratsallianzen zentrale Anliegen sind. Als sie den Weg von Mr. Darcy, einem ebenso reichen wie arroganten Aristokraten, kreuzt, ist Elizabeth sofort von seiner Kälte und seinem Stolz beeindruckt. Im Laufe der Begegnungen und Missverständnisse entdeckt sie jedoch, dass sich hinter den ersten Eindrücken ein Mann verbirgt, der viel komplexer und verletzlicher ist, als sie es sich je hätte vorstellen können.

Die größten Romane von Jane Austen,['Jane Austen'],"In ""Die größten Romane von Jane Austen"" versammelt sich das Meisterwerk der englischen Schriftstellerin, die das Genre des historischen Romans mit einer einzigartigen Kombination aus scharfer Gesellschaftskritik und feinem Humor geprägt hat. Austen entfaltet in ihren Geschichten die komplexen Netze von Liebe, Stand und Moral im England des 19. Jahrhunderts. Ihre erstklassigen Charakterprofile und die geschliffene Prosa laden den Leser ein, in eine Welt einzutauchen, die sowohl zeitgenössisch als auch zeitlos ist, während sie das Thema der Selbstfindung inmitten gesellschaftlicher Erwartungen beleuchtet. Jane Austen, geboren 1775, war eine Vorreiterin der Frauenliteratur und verfasste ihre Werke in einem Kontext, in dem Frauen kaum öffentliche Stimmen hatten. Ihre eigene Erziehung und das familiäre Umfeld prägten ihre Perspektiven auf die Rolle der Frau in der Gesellschaft. Austen war nicht nur Schriftstellerin, sondern auch eine scharfsinnige Beobachterin menschlicher Beziehungen und soziale Strukturen, was sich in den vielschichtigen Charakteren und der Auseinandersetzung mit den Fragen von Heiratsmarkt und persönlichen Wünschen niederschlägt. Für Leserinnen und Leser, die ein tiefes Verständnis für die Dynamik menschlicher Beziehungen suchen, ist dieses Buch eine unverzichtbare Lektüre.

Jane Austen's Erotic Advice,['Sarah Raff'],"In November 1814, Jane Austen's niece Fanny Knight wrote Austen a letter secretly requesting advice. Fanny wanted urgently to know whether she should continue encouraging her most ardent suitor, what the future would hold were she to marry him, and whether she, Fanny, was in love with him. Fanny evidently wished to turn over her love life to Austen's creative direction, and Austen's letters of response cooperate with this desire. Today, many readers address to Austen's novels their deepest uncertainties about their love lives. Consulting Austen-themed divination toys for news about the future or applying to their own circumstances the generalizations they have gleaned from Austen's narrator, characters, or plots, they look to Austen not for anonymous instruction but for the custom-tailored guidance-and magical intervention-of an advisor who knows them well. This book argues that Austen, inspired by her niece to embrace the most scandalous possibilities of the novel genre, sought in her three last-published novels to match her readers with real-world lovers. The fictions that Austen wrote or revised after beginning the advisory correspondence address themselves to Fanny Knight. They imagine granting Fanny a happy love life through the thaumaturgic power of literary language even as they retract Austen's epistolary advice and rewrite its results. But they also pass along the role of Fanny Knight to Austen's readers, who get a chance to be shaped by Austen's creative effort, to benefit from Austen's matchmaking prowess, and to develop nothing less than a complex love relation with Austen herself.",['Literary Criticism']

The Making of Jane Austen,['Devoney Looser'],"An engaging account of how Jane Austen became a household name. Just how did Jane Austen become the celebrity author and the inspiration for generations of loyal fans she is today? Devoney Looser's The Making of Jane Austen turns to the people, performances, activism, and images that fostered Austen's early fame, laying the groundwork for the beloved author we think we know. Here are the Austen influencers, including her first English illustrator, the eccentric Ferdinand Pickering, whose sensational gothic images may be better understood through his brushes with bullying, bigamy, and an attempted matricide. The daring director-actress Rosina Filippi shaped Austen's reputation with her pioneering dramatizations, leading thousands of young women to ventriloquize Elizabeth Bennet's audacious lines before drawing room audiences. Even the supposedly staid history of Austen scholarship has its bizarre stories. The author of the first Jane Austen dissertation, student George Pellew, tragically died young, but he was believed by many, including his professor-mentor, to have come back from the dead. Looser shows how these figures and their Austen-inspired work transformed Austen's reputation, just as she profoundly shaped theirs. Through them, Looser describes the factors and influences that radically altered Austen's evolving image. Drawing from unexplored material, Looser examines how echoes of that work reverberate in our explanations of Austen's literary and cultural power. Whether you're a devoted Janeite or simply Jane-curious, The Making of Jane Austen will have you thinking about how a literary icon is made, transformed, and handed down from generation to generation.",['Literary Criticism']
"Satire, Celebrity, and Politics in Jane Austen",['Jocelyn Harris'],"In Satire, Celebrity, and Politics in Jane Austen, Jocelyn Harris argues thatJane Austen was a satirist, a celebrity-watcher,and a keen political observer.In Mansfield Park, she appears to baseFanny Price on Fanny Burney, criticizethe royal heir as unfit to rule, and exposeSusan Burney’s cruel husband throughMr. Price. In Northanger Abbey, she satirizes the young Prince of Wales as the vulgar John Thorpe; in Persuasion, she attacks both the regent’s failure to retrench, and his dangerous desire to become another Sun King. For Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, Austen may draw on the actress Dorothy Jordan, mistress of the pro-slavery Duke of Clarence, while her West Indian heiress in Sanditon may allude to Sara Baartman, who was exhibited in Paris and London as “The Hottentot Venus,” and adopted as a test case by the abolitionists. Thoroughly researched and elegantly written, this new book by Jocelyn Harris contributes significantly to the growing literature about Austen’s worldiness by presenting a highly particularized web of facts, people, texts, and issues vital to her historical moment.",['Literary Criticism']
Jane Austen's Business,"['Juliet McMaster', 'Bruce Stovel']","Jane Austen's Business is a collection of essays that demonstrates Austen knew her business. She presents with memorable distinctness not only 'what sees keenly, speaks aptly, moves flexibly' but also 'what throbs fast and full' (Charlotte Bronte's phrases). Many of these essays, including those by Julia Prewitt Brown, Margaret Drabble, Jan Fergus, Isobel Grundy, Gary Kelly, and Elaine Showalter, are based on papers given at the Lake Louise conference on Persuasion. The collection's culmination is a short story by Margaret Drabble that brings Austen's Elliots of Kellynch Hall into the twentieth century.",['Literary Criticism']
Jane Austen's Possessions and Dispossessions,['Sandie Byrne'],"Who owns, who buys, who gives, and who notices objects is always significant in Austen's writing, placing characters socially and characterizing them symbolically. Jane Austen's Possessions and Dispossessions looks at the significance of objects in Austen's major novels, fragments, and juvenilia.",['Literary Criticism']
Jane Austen's Textual Lives,['Kathryn Sutherland'],"Through three intertwined histories Jane Austen's Textual Lives offers a new way of approaching and reading a very familiar author. One is a history of the transmission and transformation of Jane Austen through manuscripts, critical editions, biographies, and adaptations; a second provides a conspectus of the development of English Studies as a discipline in which the original and primary place of textual criticism is recovered; and a third reviews the role of Oxford University Press in shaping a canon of English texts in the twentieth century. Jane Austen can be discovered in all three. Since her rise to celebrity status at the end of the nineteenth century, Jane Austen has occupied a position within English-speaking culture that is both popular and canonical, accessible and complexly inaccessible, fixed and certain yet wonderfully amenable to shifts of sensibility and cultural assumptions. The implied contradiction was represented in the early twentieth century by, on the one hand, the Austen family's continued management, censorship, and sentimental marketing of the sweet lady novelist of the Hampshire countryside; and on the other, by R. W. Chapman's 1923 Clarendon Press edition of the Novels of Jane Austen, which subjected her texts to the kind of scholarly probing reserved till then for classical Greek and Roman authors obscured by centuries of attrition. It was to be almost fifty years before the Clarendon Press considered it necessary to recalibrate the reputation of another popular English novelist in this way. Beginning with specific encounters with three kinds of textual work and the problems, clues, or challenges to interpretation they continue to present, Kathryn Sutherland goes on to consider the absence of a satisfactory critical theory of biography that can help us address the partial life, and ends with a discussion of the screen adaptations through which the texts continue to live on. Throughout, Jane Austen's textual identities provide a means to explore the wider issue of what text is and to argue the importance of understanding textual space as itself a powerful agent established only by recourse to further interpretations and fictions.",['Literary Criticism']
Jane Austen's Heroes and Other Male Characters,['Reeta Sahney'],"JANE AUSTENâ€™S HEROES is a sociological study of her half a dozen novels from what was most difficult to master lifeâ€™s small measures, till her disc became her orb. The book deals with a few important questions whether Austenâ€™s men, heroes and other male characters are protagonists of what she stood for. Does she create fully rounded characterisations of men or make them tangential, partisan studies? Does Austen fulfil the Freudian new scientific concept of id which contains everything that is inherited? Is she influenced by the revolutionary implications of Mary Wollstonecraftâ€™s â€œA Vindication of the Rights of Womenâ€ ? Is she a Marxist Feminist or a Remorseless realist in terms of Lukacs true great realism or an incurable Romantic? The book is a meticulous, useful and a thorough study of Austen and her times.",['Literary Criticism']

Das Auftauchen der Geschwister Crawford führt zu einer Verkettung von Ereignissen, in denen Fanny ihre Menschenkenntnis beweisen kann. Auf dem Höhepunkt ihrer Karriere bezaubert Jane Austen in Mansfield Park durch Ironie, feine Satire und intensive Charakterzeichnungen.

Was sie sah, gefiel ihr ausgezeichnet, und als gute Patriotin konnte sie sich nicht vorstellen, daß es anderswo schöner sein könnte. Mit ihren Augen und durch ihre Romane sehen wir noch immer die klassischen Straßen von Bath – heute Weltkulturerbe –, das Cottage in Chawton, wo sie schrieb, die Salons, in denen sie tanzte, und die geschwungene Kaimauer von Lyme Regis, von der im Roman Anne Elliot oder die Kunst der Überredung Louisa Musgrove in Kapitän Wentworths Arme springen will und auf dem Pflaster landet.",['Travel']

30 Great Myths about Jane Austen,"['Claudia L. Johnson', 'Clara Tuite']","A fascinating look into the myths that continue to shape our understanding and appreciation of Jane Austen. Was Jane Austen the best-selling novelist of her time? Are all her novels romances? Did they depict the traditional world of the aristocracy? Is Austen's writing easy to understand? Well into the 21st century, Jane Austen continues to be one of the most compelling novelists in all English literature. Many of her ideas about class, family, history, intimacy, manners, love, desire, and society, have inspired ""myths"" that are often contradictory — she was a Tory who was also a liberal feminist, or, her novels are at once sharply satirical and unapologetically romantic. Myths, like Austen's works, are dynamic, changing over time and impacting how we read and interpret literature. 30 Great Myths about Jane Austen examines the accepted beliefs — both true and untrue —that have most influenced our readings of Austen. Rather than simply de-bunking, or validating, commonly-held views about Austen, authors Claudia L. Johnson and Clara Tuite explore how these myths can be used to engage with the life, work, and reception of Jane Austen. Applying the most up-to-date scholarship to better understand how myths shape our appreciation of Jane Austen, this fascinating volume: Introduces readers to the history of Austen reception, both in academic scholarship and in the general public Examines Jane Austen’s life and letters, her historical contexts, her texts, and their afterlives Discusses Austen’s influence on the development of literary criticism as a discipline Explores each of Austen’s main novels, as well as relatively obscure texts such as Sanditon and The Watsons Offering engaging narrative and original insights, 30 Great Myths about Jane Austen is a must-read for scholars, instructors, and students of English and Romantic literature, as well as general readers with interest in the life and works of Jane Austen.",['Literary Criticism']

Jane Austen-Mansfield Park,['Sandie Byrne'],"The first novel of the author's maturity, Mansfield Park is complex, highly wrought, and experimental. It marks a transitional stage between the first two published novels, Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice, and Jane Austen's greatest achievements, Emma and Persuasion. It has been suggested that Mansfield Park is the writer's most autobiographical novel and that, in seeing through the eyes of Fanny Price, deemed the most moralising and judgemental of her heroines, we are seeing through the eyes of Austen herself. Though Fanny Price may be too virtuous for modern readers to take to their hearts, in Mrs Norris Austen creates one of her best, because most plausible, monsters; while in the estate of Mansfield Park itself we find some of the most fully realised descriptions of domestic interiors and exteriors in Austen's fiction. This Guide traces the response to Mansfield Park from the opinions of Jane Austen's contemporaries, through 19th century reviews and 20th century critical analyses, including deconstructionist, feminist, postcolonial and poststructuralist, to diverse 21st century approaches to the novel. Sandie Byrne selects the most useful and insightful of these responses and puts them in context, providing the reader with an essential and approachable introduction to the range of critical debate on this important novel.",['Fiction']

The Jane Austen Writers' Club,['Rebecca Smith'],"A spirited and useful guide for writers with tips and tricks from Jane Austen, whose novels stand the test of time, by her great great great great grand niece. Pretty much anything anyone needs to know about writing can be learned from Jane Austen. While creative writing manuals tend to use examples from twentieth- and twenty-first-century writers, The Jane Austen Writers Club is the first to look at the methods and devices used by the world's most beloved novelist. Austen was a creator of immortal characters and a pioneer in her use of language and point of view; her advice continues to be relevant two centuries after her death. Here Rebecca Smith examines the major aspects of writing fiction--plotting, characterization, openings and endings, dialogue, settings, and writing methods--sharing the advice Austen gave in letters to her aspiring novelist nieces and nephew, and providing many and varied exercises for writers to try, using examples from Austen's work. Exercises include: *Show your character doing the thing he or she most loves doing. In the opening scene of Persuasion, Sir Walter Elliot looks himself up in the Baronetage, which is the Regency equivalent of Googling oneself. That single scene gives us a clear understanding of the kind of man he is and sets up the plot. * Use Jane Austen's first attempts at stories to get yourself started. Write a very short story inspired by The Beautifull Cassandra, a work of eighteenth-century flash fiction. The Jane Austen Writers Club is a fresh primer on writing that features utterly timeless advice.",['Language Arts & Disciplines']

Jane Austen and the Victorian Heroine,['Cheryl A. Wilson'],"This book uses the figure of the Victorian heroine as a lens through which to examine Jane Austen’s presence in Victorian critical and popular writings. Aimed at Victorianist readers and scholars, the book focuses on the ways in which Austen was constructed in fiction, criticism, and biography over the course of the nineteenth century. For the Victorians, Austen became a kind of cultural shorthand, representing a distant, yet not too-distant, historical past that the Victorians both drew on and defined themselves against with regard to such topics as gender, literature, and national identity. Austen influenced the development of the Victorian literary heroine, and when cast as a heroine herself, was deployed in debates about the responsibilities of the novelist and the ability of fiction to shape social and cultural norms. Thus, the study is as much, if not more, about the Victorians than it is about Jane Austen.",['Literary Criticism']
Jane Austen's Sanditon,['Arthur M. Axelrad'],"When Jane Austen died in 1817, she left behind 120 pages of manuscript that would eventually be published as Sanditon. Praised by some critics and condemned by others, this final effort by the great English writer has for the most part been overlooked in favor of the novels that were published during her lifetime and shortly after her death. For the first time, an entire book is devoted to examining this fragment to establish it as Jane Austen's potential masterpiece. With a new setting and a greater range of characters than found in earlier works, this novel composed during the last months of her short life, if completed, would at the same time have continued her series of magnificent novels and created new possibilities for novels to come.",['Fiction']
"Jane Austen, Early and Late",['Freya Johnston'],"A reexamination of Austen’s unpublished writings that uncovers their continuity with her celebrated novels—and that challenges distinctions between her “early” and “late” work Jane Austen’s six novels, published toward the end of her short life, represent a body of work that is as brilliant as it is compact. Her earlier writings have routinely been dismissed as mere juvenilia, or stepping stones to mature proficiency and greatness. Austen’s first biographer described them as “childish effusions.” Was he right to do so? Can the novels be definitively separated from the unpublished works? In Jane Austen, Early and Late, Freya Johnston argues that they cannot. Examining the three manuscript volumes in which Austen collected her earliest writings, Johnston finds that Austen’s regard and affection for them are revealed by her continuing to revisit and revise them throughout her adult life. The teenage works share the milieu and the humour of the novels, while revealing more clearly the sources and influences upon which Austen drew. Johnston upends the conventional narrative, according to which Austen discarded the satire and fantasy of her first writings in favour of the irony and realism of the novels. By demonstrating a stylistic and thematic continuity across the full range of Austen’s work, Johnston asks whether it makes sense to speak of an early and a late Austen at all. Jane Austen, Early and Late offers a new picture of the author in all her complexity and ambiguity, and shows us that it is not necessarily true that early work yields to later, better things.",['Literary Criticism']

10 Christians Everyone Should Know,['John Perry'],"Jane Austen, Sergeant York, Saint Patrick—What did they have in common? Two thousand years and still going strong: that’s the story of Christianity. And while the Christian martyrs and saints and orators may have gotten more press, the fact is the faith has been carried through history in the hearts and deeds of believers who—though beloved to us now—were simply living ordinary lives of devotion. “It would be almost impossible to imagine ten people more different from each other than these,” editor John Perry says. “This [is] the first truth of Christian living: anybody, anywhere can be a champion of the faith, an example and inspiration to all who follow.” There’s no dry biography here, though. Each story teems with fresh insight. D. L. Moody did some of his most powerful evangelizing by befriending ragged street children in Chicago. William F. Buckley never delivered a sermon, yet a Christian worldview informed his erudite, witty, output in print and broadcasting. To compose her poems, Anne Bradstreet had to understand science, history, the Bible, and literature, not to mention the political scene in both Massachusetts and England. You’ll look with new eyes, also, on the lives of George Washington Carver, Jane Austen, Galileo, Johann Sebastian Bach, Sergeant York, John Bunyan, and Saint Patrick. You might think you know their stories . . . but you don’t. Not yet. For lovers of biography, for homeschool or study groups, for anyone seeking encouragement in the Christian walk, 10 Christians Everyone Should Know is a valuable resource.",['Religion']
Jane Austen. 100 Seiten,['Christian Grawe'],"»Als ich das erste Kapitel von Stolz und Vorurteil beendet hatte, sagte ich zu meiner Frau: ›Noch nie habe ich einen so charmanten Romananfang gelesen.‹ – Ich wurde zum ›Janeite‹.« Jane Austens Romane gehören zu den meistgelesenen Klassikern der englischen Literatur. Ihre Geschichten über die amourösen Verwicklungen der englischen Gentry, die sie mit viel Herz, aber auch mit ihrem ganz eigenen Sinn für Humor und Ironie erzählt, begeistern immer wieder neue Leserinnen und Leser. Christian Grawe begegnete Jane Austens Romanen vor bald 50 Jahren zum ersten Mal: Es war der Beginn einer lebenslangen Leidenschaft. Die Übersetzungen, die er zusammen mit seiner Frau Ursula vorgelegt hat, haben zu Austens Popularität im deutschsprachigen Raum wesentlich beigetragen. Er hat mehrere Bücher über sie geschrieben und ist einer der besten deutschsprachigen Kenner von Leben und Werk. Seine Begeisterung für diese außergewöhnliche Schriftstellerin möchte er in diesem schmalen Band weitergeben. Entstanden ist eine ganz persönliche Einführung in Jane Austens Leben, die Zeit, in der sie gelebt, und die Welt, die sie in ihren Romanen erschaffen hat. Mit 4-farbigen Abbildungen und Infografiken.",['Biography & Autobiography']
A New Jane Austen,['Juliette Wells'],"Completing Juliette Wells' groundbreaking trio of books on Austen's readers, this latest volume revolutionizes our understanding of how Austen came to be viewed as the world's greatest novelist. Wells shows that Austen's global reputation was established not by British scholars, as is commonly believed, but by visionary American writers and collectors, working largely outside academia. Drawing on extensive research, Wells weaves together colorful, compelling case studies of men and women who, from the 1880s to the 1980s, helped readers appreciate Austen's novels, persuasively advocated for her place in the literary canon, and preserved artifacts vital to her legacy. Engagingly written and abundantly illustrated, A New Jane Austen will inform and delight scholars and Austen fans alike.",['Literary Criticism']

Textual Studies and the Enlarged Eighteenth Century,"['Kevin L. Cope', 'Robert C. Leitz III']","Scholars, librarians, students, and database vendors have all applauded the increase in access to rare, old, venerated, and obscure texts that has resulted from the rise of electronic resources. Almost everyone associated with any branch of cultural history has heard the claims about unlimited research opportunity and the rediscovery of overlooked sources. But are these claims true? Have high-tech systems and methods enhanced or inhibited scholarship? Nowhere is this question more pressing than in the area of eighteenth-century studies, where so much of the subject matter relates to the first wave of informational abundance: to that great period of profuse printing during which presses produced a mass market full of diverse readers. Textual Studies and the Enlarged Eighteenth Century probes the assumptions about the advanced tools that may be replicating this period of profusion among contemporary scholars. How much access to “period” information do current cost and present institutional support really allow? Who is accessing what—and who is not? Which authors and which topics get lost in the processor-driven shuffle? How do electronic tools bias scholarship? What are the disadvantages of databases? These and many more questions receive a brisk and robust review in this first critique of new-wave research. A variety of acclaimed scholars from an interdisciplinary array of specialties look at topics ranging from legacy bibliographical projects to standards for online editions to para-textual materials to the appropriateness of importing electronic research techniques into the study of a low-tech period and on to the transatlantic exchange of information in both the early modern and the present periods. Scholars in all fields will benefit from this vigorous analysis of the assumptions underlying the tools and the methods of twenty-first century humanities scholarship.",['Literary Criticism']
A Jane Austen Christmas,['Carlo DeVito'],"Filled with the remarkable wit and insight of one of the world's most cherished authors, A Jane Austen Christmas gives readers insight into Austen's life through little-known stories about how she and her family celebrated the treasured holiday season. Carlo DeVito provides an intimate portrait of Austen's most cherished Christmas memories with her family: from the gift of her first writing desk, to her first love and heartbreak, to her brewing mead and beer in time for the holidays. Along the way readers will spend a holiday in the Austen house, celebrate Jane's birthday, meet the inspiration for more than a dozen characters, attend the Christmastide series of balls, and learn how to make family's favorite recipes and dedicate a novel to the Prince Regent. Remarkably fresh and supremely entertaining, A Jane Austen Christmas brings Austen's world to life as never before.",['Biography & Autobiography']
Levinas and Nineteenth-century Literature,"['Donald R. Wehrs', 'David P. Haney']","Levinas and Nineteenth-Century Literature presents nine essays that reread major British, American, and European nineteenth-century literary texts in light of the post-deconstruction ethical philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. The first section pursues in essays on Wordsworth, Coleridge, De Quincey, and Baudelaire connections between Levinas's radical rethinking of subjectivity and Romantic generic, aesthetic, and conceptual innovation. The second section explores how Levinas's analysis of totalizing thought may illuminate how Poe, Emerson, Hawthorne, Douglass, Susan Warner, and Melville grapple with American experience and culture. The third section considers the relevance of Levinas's work for reassessments of the realist novel through essays on Austen, Dickens, and George Eliot. Essay authors are A.C. Goodson, David P. Haney, E.S. Burt, Alain Paul Toumayan, N.S. Boone, Lorna Wood, Donald R. Wehrs, Melvyn New, and Rachel Hollander. Donald R. Wehrs is Associate Professor of English at Auburn University. David P.

Die sechs Romane,['Jane Austen'],"Alle sechs Romane Jane Austens in der Übersetzung von Ursula und Christian Grawe mit einem Nachwort: Emma, Kloster Northanger, Mansfield Park, Stolz und Vorurteil, Überredung, Verstand und Gefühl. Die inzwischen klassischen Übersetzungen von Ursula und Christian Grawe haben wesentlich dazu beigetragen, Jane Austen im deutschsprachigen Raum populär zu machen. Die Nachworte, die sie jedem Roman beigefügt haben, erschließen den Leser/-innen Jane Austens Welt. Zu den Romanen: Stolz und Vorurteil: Dieser Roman gehört zu den erfolgreichsten Liebesgeschichten der Weltliteratur. Eine gehörige Portion ""Stolz"" muss abgelegt und so manches ""Vorurteil"" aus dem Weg geräumt werden, bis Elizabeth und Mr. Darcy endlich ein Paar werden. Mansfield Park: Jane Austen bezaubert in ""Mansfield Park"" - jetzt auf dem Höhepunkt ihrer schriftstellerischen Karriere - durch Ironie, feine Satire und intensive Charakterzeichnungen. Das vehemente Engagement gilt auch hier dem Recht der Heldin auf Selbstbestimmung. Verstand und Gefühl: Ein Roman aus dem ländlichen England des 18. Jahrhunderts über die beiden Schwestern Elinor und Marianne, die bis zum Traualtar einen dornenreichen Weg zurücklegen müssen. Emma: Emma Woodhouse, Anfang Zwanzig, führt den Haushalt ihres gesundheitlich angeschlagenen Vaters. Das führt zu Missverständnissen und Liebeskummer. Doch nicht zuletzt wegen Emmas Humor lösen sich die Verwirrungen und Verwicklungen in einem guten Ende auf. Überredung: Acht Jahre ist es her, dass sich Anne Elliot von ihrem Vater überreden ließ, den Heiratsantrag Frederick Wentworths zurückzuweisen. Als sich beide eines Tages wieder begegnen, beginnt eine zaghafte Annäherung, die in einer der originellsten Liebeserklärungen der Weltliteratur ihren Höhepunkt findet.

Literature and the Arts,['Anna Battigelli'],"The ten essays in Literature and the Arts explore the intermedial plenitude of eighteenth-century English culture, honoring the memory of James Anderson Winn, whose work demonstrated how seeing that interplay of the arts and literature was essential to a full understanding of Restoration and eighteenth-century English culture. Scenery, machinery, music, dance, and texts transformed one another, both enriching and complicating generic distinctions. Artists were alive to the power of the arts to reflect and shape reality, and their audience was quick to turn to the arts as performative pleasures and critical lenses through which to understand a changing world. This collection's eminent authors discuss estate design, musicalized theater, the visual spectacle of musical performance, stage machinery and set designs, the social uses of painting and singing, drama’s reflection of a transformed military infrastructure, and the arts of memory and of laughter.",['Art']

Stolz und Vorurteil & Emma,['Jane Austen'],"In Jane Austens Meisterwerken 'Stolz und Vorurteil' und 'Emma' wird die gesellschaftliche Stellung der Frauen im frühen 19. Jahrhundert bewegend und scharfsinnig thematisiert. 'Stolz und Vorurteil' folgt der leidenschaftlichen und ironisch gehobenen Beziehung zwischen Elizabeth Bennet und Mr. Darcy, während 'Emma' die Entwicklung der selbsternannten Matchmakerin Emma Woodhouse beleuchtet, die zunehmend mit ihren eigenen Fehlannahmen konfrontiert wird. Austens Stil ist geprägt von einer feinen Ironie und einem tiefen Verständnis der menschlichen Natur, das eindringlich die Komplexität von Beziehungen und gesellschaftlichen Normen erforscht. Jane Austen, geboren 1775 in Steventon, Hampshire, gilt als eine der ersten großen Romanciers der englischen Literatur, die sowohl den Alltag als auch die inneren Konflikte ihrer Figuren präzise einfängt. Ihre Werke, die oft aus ihrer eigenen Erfahrung schöpfen, thematisieren die Herausforderungen der Frauen im Spätgeorgianischen England, und reflektieren Austens eigene Ansichten über Liebe, Heiratsmarkt und soziale Stellung. Ihre scharfe Beobachtungsgabe und ihr anhaltendes Interesse an den Nuancen zwischenmenschlicher Beziehungen machen sie zu einer zeitlosen Stimme. Diese beiden Romane sind nicht nur unterhaltsam, sondern bieten auch tiefe Einsichten in die menschliche Psyche und sozialen Strukturen. Sie sind eine unbedingte Leseempfehlung für alle, die sich für die Verbindung von Humor, Romantik und Kritik an gesellschaftlichen Normen interessieren. Austens genussvoll gewebte Geschichten laden den Leser ein, die subtilen Verstrickungen des Herzens und den Konflikt zwischen individuellen Wünschen und gesellschaftlichen Erwartungen zu erkunden.",['Fiction']

Schon früh entwickelt sich Jane zu einer bemerkenswerten jungen Frau, die ihrer Zeit weit voraus ist. Sie beansprucht für sich das Recht, ihren Partner frei zu wählen, und ihr Leben ist geprägt von Romantik und Leidenschaft. Drei Männer gibt es in ihrem kurzen Leben: ihre große Liebe Tom Lefroy – ihr Mr Darcy, den sie aber nicht heiraten darf –, der reiche Mr Witherton, dessen Antrag sie ablehnt, weil sie keine Zuneigung empfindet, und der intrigante Philipp Trevelyan, der Jane begehrt, aber verrät. Jane Austens lebenslange Leidenschaft aber gehört dem Schreiben.

An A-Z of Jane Austen,['Michael Greaney'],"Jane Austen's richly textured worlds have enchanted readers for centuries and this neatly organised, playful book provides Austen enthusiasts and students alike with a unique insight into the much-loved writer's way with words. Using a lively A-Z structure, Greaney provides fresh angles on familiar Austen themes (D is for dance; M is for matchmaking), casts light on under-examined corners of her imagination (R is for risk; S is for servant), and shows how current social and cultural concerns are re-shaping our understanding of her work (Q is for queer; W is for West Indies). Through this approach, we learn how attention to the tiniest linguistic detail in Austen's work can yield rewarding new perspectives on the achievements of one of our most celebrated authors. Sharply focused on textual detail but broad in scope it broaches questions that, like Austen's work, will intrigue, delight and inspire: Why are children so marginal in her storylines? Who is the best exponent of matchmaking in her fiction? Why are many of her female characters – but none of her heroines – called Jane? Providing a new close-up encounter with one of our most celebrated writers, this book invites a renewed appreciation of the infinite subtlety and endless re-readability of a body of writing in which every word counts.",['Literary Criticism']

Marriage could also be a life sentence. Myer shows that by many accounts Austen was pretty and flirtatious (though occasionally also sharp-tongued), and the object of at least two proposals, but obstinate in her refusal to marry for other than love. Her obstinacy condemned her to reliance on her family for financial support. As Myer points out, it also enabled Austen to write her immortal novels.",['Biography & Autobiography']

It provides a broad-ranging survey from the major authors and works through to the sub-genres of the period. Jan Austin and Sir Alter Scott are discussed alongside the Gothic Romance, political and feminist fiction, social satire and regional, rural and historical novels.

Austen's Unbecoming Conjunctions,['Jill Heydt-Stevenson'],"This lucid and insightful work investigates the role that dissident comedy plays in Austen’s writings. Using sexuality as a lens upon circa-1800 literary culture, this book emphasizes the physical life of Austen’s heroines, and contributes to recent analyses of popular culture, thing theory, and material history. Through her focus on objects, Heydt-Stevenson argues that Austen’s novels explore the physical, erotic, humorous, and sometimes tragically funny connotations of popular literature and commonplace books, clothing, jewelry, crafts, travel, and tourism. Through an examination of Austen’s humor and linguistic patterns, this book interrogates the stereotypes of women authors as culturally inhibited, and shows how Austen addressed as sophisticated and worldly an audience as Byron's. Through her careful reading of all the Austen texts in light of the language of eroticism, both traditional and contemporary, Heydt-Stevenson reevaluates Austen's audience, the novels, and her role as a writer.",['Fiction']

Stolz und Vorurteil & Jane Eyre,"['Charlotte Brontë', 'Jane Austen']","Die Anthologie 'Stolz und Vorurteil & Jane Eyre' vereint zwei der bemerkenswertesten Werke der britischen Literatur des 19. Jahrhunderts. Diese Sammlung bietet einen faszinierenden Einblick in die gesellschaftlichen und emotionalen Landschaften, die Jane Austen und Charlotte Brontë meisterhaft ergründet haben. Während Austens 'Stolz und Vorurteil' die subtile Kunst der sozialen Beobachtung und feinen Ironie verkörpert, verdichtet Charlotte Brontë in 'Jane Eyre' eine kraftvolle Erzählung von Selbstbestimmung und innerer Integrität. Der literarische Kontext dieser Werke erstreckt sich über die Regency-Ära und die Viktorianische Periode, eine Zeit bedeutender gesellschaftlicher Veränderungen und literarischer Innovation. Die beiden Autorinnen sind zentrale Figuren der englischen Literatur, deren Einflüsse weit über ihre jeweilige Epoche hinausreichen. Jane Austen, bekannt für ihre scharfsinnige Gesellschaftskritik, und Charlotte Brontë, deren Prosa das Leid und die Leidenschaft ihrer Zeit eindrucksvoll einfängt, erscheinen in dieser Anthologie als Stimmen, die sich sowohl in ihrer Perspektive als auch in ihrem Erzähltalent ergänzen. Themen wie soziale Schichtung, Geschlechterrollen und persönliche Freiheit durchziehen ihre Werke und werden durch die historische und kulturelle Linse des 19. Jahrhunderts lebendig. Diese Sammlung ist eine unverzichtbare Lektüre für jeden, der die literarischen Höhen des 19. Jahrhunderts erforschen möchte. Sie bietet eine einzigartige Gelegenheit, die feinen Nuancen der Prosa von Austen und Brontë zu erleben, und ermöglicht es dem Leser, die Vielfalt ihrer stilistischen Ansätze und ihre gemeinsamen Themen in einem Band zu genießen.

"Revolution and the Form of the British Novel, 1790-1825",['Nicola J. Watson'],"Whatever happened to the epistolary novel? Why was it that by 1825 the principal narrative form of eighteenth-century fiction had been replaced by the third-person and often historicized models which have predominated ever since? Nicola Watson's original and wide-ranging study charts the suppression of epistolary fiction, exploring the attempted radicalization of the genre by Wollstonecraft and other feminists in the 1790s; its rejection and parody by Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth: the increasingly discredited role played by letters in the historical novels of Jane Porter, Sydney Morgan, and Walter Scott; and their troubling, ghostly presence in the gothic narratives of James Hogg and Charles Maturin. The shift in narrative method is seen as a response to anxieties about the French Revolution, with the epistolary, feminized, and sentimental plot replaced by a more authoritarian third-person mode as part of a wider redrawing of the relation between the individual and social consensus. This is a brilliant and innovative reading of the place of the novel in the reformulation of British national identity in the Napoleonic period, throwing new light on writers as diverse as Hazlitt, Charlotte Smith, Walter Scott, Helen Maria Williams, and Byron.",['Language Arts & Disciplines']
